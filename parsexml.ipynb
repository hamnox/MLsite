       "  'summary': u'  Manual analysis of body poses of bed-ridden patients requires staff to\\ncontinuously track and record patient poses. Two limitations in the\\ndissemination of pose-related therapies are scarce human resources and\\nunreliable automated systems. This work addresses these issues by introducing a\\nnew method and a new system for robust automated classification of sleep poses\\nin an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) environment. The new method,\\ncoupled-constrained Least-Squares (cc-LS), uses multimodal and multiview (MM)\\ndata and finds the set of modality trust values that minimizes the difference\\nbetween expected and estimated labels. The new system, Eye-CU, is an affordable\\nmulti-sensor modular system for unobtrusive data collection and analysis in\\nhealthcare. Experimental results indicate that the performance of cc-LS matches\\nthe performance of existing methods in ideal scenarios. This method outperforms\\nthe latest techniques in challenging scenarios by 13% for those with poor\\nillumination and by 70% for those with both poor illumination and occlusions.\\nResults also show that a reduced Eye-CU configuration can classify poses\\nwithout pressure information with only a slight drop in its performance.\\n',\n",

We address the first challenge by using\\nvalue functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient\\nestimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of\\nthe advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second\\nchallenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and\\nthe value function, which are represented by neural networks.\\n  Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D\\nlocomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated\\nrobots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting\\nout lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses\\nhand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly\\nfrom raw kinematics to joint torques.

       "  'summary': u\"  Capabilities of inference and prediction are significant components of visual\\nsystems. In this paper, we address an important and challenging task of them:\\nvisual path prediction. Its goal is to infer the future path for a visual\\nobject in a static scene. This task is complicated as it needs high-level\\nsemantic understandings of both the scenes and motion patterns underlying video\\nsequences. In practice, cluttered situations have also raised higher demands on\\nthe effectiveness and robustness of the considered models. Motivated by these\\nobservations, we propose a deep learning framework which simultaneously\\nperforms deep feature learning for visual representation in conjunction with\\nspatio-temporal context modeling. After that, we propose a unified path\\nplanning scheme to make accurate future path prediction based on the analytic\\nresults of the context models. The highly effective visual representation and\\ndeep context models ensure that our framework makes a deep semantic\\nunderstanding of the scene and motion pattern, consequently improving the\\nperformance of the visual path prediction task. In order to comprehensively\\nevaluate the model's performance on the visual path prediction task, we\\nconstruct two large benchmark datasets from the adaptation of video tracking\\ndatasets. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our\\napproach outperforms the existing approaches and owns a better generalization\\ncapability.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u\"  The reconstruction of an object's shape or surface from a set of 3D points is\\na common topic in materials and life sciences, computationally handled in\\ncomputer graphics. Such points usually stem from optical or tactile 3D\\ncoordinate measuring equipment. Surface reconstruction also appears in medical\\nimage analysis, e.g. in anatomy reconstruction from tomographic measurements or\\nthe alignment of intra-operative navigation and preoperative planning data. In\\ncontrast to mere 3D point clouds, medical imaging yields contextual information\\non the 3D point data that can be used to adopt prior information on the shape\\nthat is to be reconstructed from the measurements. In this work we propose to\\nuse a statistical shape model (SSM) as a prior for surface reconstruction. The\\nprior knowledge is represented by a point distribution model (PDM) that is\\nassociated with a surface mesh. Using the shape distribution that is modelled\\nby the PDM, we reformulate the problem of surface reconstruction from a\\nprobabilistic perspective based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In order to\\ndo so, the given measurements are interpreted as samples of the GMM. By using\\nmixture components with anisotropic covariances that are oriented according to\\nthe surface normals at the PDM points, a surface-based fitting is accomplished.\\nBy estimating the parameters of the GMM in a maximum a posteriori manner, the\\nreconstruction of the surface from the given measurements is achieved.\\nExtensive experiments suggest that our proposed approach leads to superior\\nsurface reconstructions compared to Iterative Closest Point (ICP) methods.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u'  In classification of incomplete pattern, the missing values can either play a\\ncrucial role in the class determination, or have only little influence (or\\neventually none) on the classification results according to the context. We\\npropose a credal classification method for incomplete pattern with adaptive\\nimputation of missing values based on belief function theory. At first, we try\\nto classify the object (incomplete pattern) based only on the available\\nattribute values. As underlying principle, we assume that the missing\\ninformation is not crucial for the classification if a specific class for the\\nobject can be found using only the available information. In this case, the\\nobject is committed to this particular class. However, if the object cannot be\\nclassified without ambiguity, it means that the missing values play a main role\\nfor achieving an accurate classification. In this case, the missing values will\\nbe imputed based on the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and self-organizing map (SOM)\\ntechniques, and the edited pattern with the imputation is then classified. The\\n(original or edited) pattern is respectively classified according to each\\ntraining class, and the classification results represented by basic belief\\nassignments are fused with proper combination rules for making the credal\\nclassification. The object is allowed to belong with different masses of belief\\nto the specific classes and meta-classes (which are particular disjunctions of\\nseveral single classes). The credal classification captures well the\\nuncertainty and imprecision of classification, and reduces effectively the rate\\nof misclassifications thanks to the introduction of meta-classes. The\\neffectiveness of the proposed method with respect to other classical methods is\\ndemonstrated based on several experiments using artificial and real data sets.\\n',\n",

In this work we propose to\\ncombine \\\\emph{generative unsupervised feature learning} with a\\n\\\\emph{probabilistic treatment of oracle information like triplets} in order to\\ntransfer implicit privileged oracle knowledge into explicit nonlinear Bayesian\\nlatent factor models of the observations. We use a fast variational algorithm\\nto learn the joint model and demonstrate applicability to a well-known image\\ndataset. We show how implicit triplet information can provide rich information\\nto learn representations that outperform previous metric learning approaches as\\nwell as generative models without this side-information in a variety of\\npredictive tasks. In addition, we illustrate that the proposed approach\\ncompartmentalizes the latent spaces semantically which allows interpretation of\\nthe latent variables.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Deep Neural Networks have demonstrated outstanding performance in many\\nComputer Vision tasks but typically require large amounts of labeled training\\ndata to achieve it. This is a serious limitation when such data is difficult to\\nobtain. In traditional Machine Learning, Domain Adaptation is an approach to\\novercoming this problem by leveraging annotated data from a source domain, in\\nwhich it is abundant, to train a classifier to operate in a target domain, in\\nwhich labeled data is either sparse or even lacking altogether. In the Deep\\nLearning case, most existing methods use the same architecture with the same\\nweights for both source and target data, which essentially amounts to learning\\ndomain invariant features. Here, we show that it is more effective to\\nexplicitly model the shift from one domain to the other. To this end, we\\nintroduce a two-stream architecture, one of which operates in the source domain\\nand the other in the target domain. In contrast to other approaches, the\\nweights in corresponding layers are related but not shared to account for\\ndifferences between the two domains. We demonstrate that this both yields\\nhigher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods on several object recognition and\\ndetection tasks and consistently outperforms networks with shared weights in\\nboth supervised and unsupervised settings.\\n',\n",

This paper studies the problem of recovering the\\ncausal structure in network of multivariate linear Hawkes processes. In such\\nprocesses, the occurrence of an event in one process affects the probability of\\noccurrence of new events in some other processes. Thus, a natural notion of\\ncausality exists between such processes captured by the support of the\\nexcitation matrix. We show that the resulting causal influence network is\\nequivalent to the Directed Information graph (DIG) of the processes, which\\nencodes the causal factorization of the joint distribution of the processes.\\nFurthermore, we present an algorithm for learning the support of excitation\\nmatrix (or equivalently the DIG). The performance of the algorithm is evaluated\\non synthesized multivariate Hawkes networks as well as a stock market and\\nMemeTracker real-world dataset.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Automatic quality evaluation of Web information is a task with many fields of\\napplications and of great relevance, especially in critical domains like the\\nmedical one.

First,\\nthe usage of a specific vocabulary (Domain Informativeness); then, the adoption\\nof specific codes (like those used in the infoboxes of Wikipedia articles) and\\nthe type of document (e.g., historical and technical ones). In this paper, we\\npropose to leverage specific domain features to improve the results of the\\nevaluation of Wikipedia medical articles.

       "  'summary': u'  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) holds as a classical method to build large\\nscale machine learning models over big data. A stochastic gradient is typically\\ncalculated from a limited number of samples (known as mini-batch), so it\\npotentially incurs a high variance and causes the estimated parameters bounce\\naround the optimal solution. To improve the stability of stochastic gradient,\\nrecent years have witnessed the proposal of several semi-stochastic gradient\\ndescent algorithms, which distinguish themselves from standard SGD by\\nincorporating global information into gradient computation. In this paper we\\ncontribute a novel stratified semi-stochastic gradient descent (S3GD) algorithm\\nto this nascent research area, accelerating the optimization of a large family\\nof composite convex functions. Though theoretically converging faster, prior\\nsemi-stochastic algorithms are found to suffer from high iteration complexity,\\nwhich makes them even slower than SGD in practice on many datasets. In our\\nproposed S3GD, the semi-stochastic gradient is calculated based on efficient\\nmanifold propagation, which can be numerically accomplished by sparse matrix\\nmultiplications. This way S3GD is able to generate a highly-accurate estimate\\nof the exact gradient from each mini-batch with largely-reduced computational\\ncomplexity. Theoretic analysis reveals that the proposed S3GD elegantly\\nbalances the geometric algorithmic convergence rate against the space and time\\ncomplexities during the optimization. The efficacy of S3GD is also\\nexperimentally corroborated on several large-scale benchmark datasets.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Real-time bidding (RTB) has become one of the largest online advertising\\nmarkets in the world. Today the bid price per ad impression is typically\\ndecided by the expected value of how it can lead to a desired action event\\n(e.g., registering an account or placing a purchase order) to the advertiser.\\nHowever, this industry standard approach to decide the bid price does not\\nconsider the actual effect of the ad shown to the user, which should be\\nmeasured based on the performance lift among users who have been or have not\\nbeen exposed to a certain treatment of ads. In this paper, we propose a new\\nbidding strategy and prove that if the bid price is decided based on the\\nperformance lift rather than absolute performance value, advertisers can\\nactually gain more action events. We describe the modeling methodology to\\npredict the performance lift and demonstrate the actual performance gain\\nthrough blind A/B test with real ad campaigns in an industry-leading\\nDemand-Side Platform (DSP). We also discuss the relationship between\\nattribution models and bidding strategies. We prove that, to move the DSPs to\\nbid based on performance lift, they should be rewarded according to the\\nrelative performance lift they contribute.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We consider dimensionality reduction methods for face recognition in a\\nsupervised setting, using an image-as-matrix representation. A common procedure\\nis to project image matrices into a smaller space in which the recognition is\\nperformed. These methods are often called \"two-dimensional\" in the literature\\nand there exist counterparts that use an image-as-vector representation. When\\ntwo face images are close to each other in the input space they may remain\\nclose after projection - but this is not desirable in the situation when these\\ntwo images are from different classes, and this often affects the recognition\\nperformance. We extend a previously developed `repulsion Laplacean\\' technique\\nbased on adding terms to the objective function with the goal or creation a\\nrepulsion energy between such images in the projected space. This scheme, which\\nrelies on a repulsion graph, is generic and can be incorporated into various\\ntwo-dimensional methods. It can be regarded as a multilinear generalization of\\nthe repulsion strategy by Kokiopoulou and Saad [Pattern Recog., 42 (2009), pp.\\n2392--2402].

       "  'summary': u'  Latent Variable Models (LVMs) are a large family of machine learning models\\nproviding a principled and effective way to extract underlying patterns,\\nstructure and knowledge from observed data. Due to the dramatic growth of\\nvolume and complexity of data, several new challenges have emerged and cannot\\nbe effectively addressed by existing LVMs: (1) How to capture long-tail\\npatterns that carry crucial information when the popularity of patterns is\\ndistributed in a power-law fashion? (2) How to reduce model complexity and\\ncomputational cost without compromising the modeling power of LVMs? (3) How to\\nimprove the interpretability and reduce the redundancy of discovered patterns?\\nTo addresses the three challenges discussed above, we develop a novel\\nregularization technique for LVMs, which controls the geometry of the latent\\nspace during learning to enable the learned latent components of LVMs to be\\ndiverse in the sense that they are favored to be mutually different from each\\nother, to accomplish long-tail coverage, low redundancy, and better\\ninterpretability. We propose a mutual angular regularizer (MAR) to encourage\\nthe components in LVMs to have larger mutual angles. The MAR is non-convex and\\nnon-smooth, entailing great challenges for optimization. To cope with this\\nissue, we derive a smooth lower bound of the MAR and optimize the lower bound\\ninstead. We show that the monotonicity of the lower bound is closely aligned\\nwith the MAR to qualify the lower bound as a desirable surrogate of the MAR.\\nUsing neural network (NN) as an instance, we analyze how the MAR affects the\\ngeneralization performance of NN. On two popular latent variable models ---\\nrestricted Boltzmann machine and distance metric learning, we demonstrate that\\nMAR can effectively capture long-tail patterns, reduce model complexity without\\nsacrificing expressivity and improve interpretability.\\n',\n",

One important problem is to automatically detect students that are\\ngoing to do poorly in a course early enough to be able to take remedial\\nactions. Existing grade prediction systems focus on maximizing the accuracy of\\nthe prediction while overseeing the importance of issuing timely and\\npersonalized predictions. This paper proposes an algorithm that predicts the\\nfinal grade of each student in a class.

       "  'summary': u'  We introduce the \"exponential linear unit\" (ELU) which speeds up learning in\\ndeep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like\\nrectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs\\n(PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for\\npositive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared\\nto the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have\\nnegative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero\\nlike batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts\\ntoward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the\\nunit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and\\nPReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust\\ndeactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and\\nthereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore,\\nELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while\\nthey do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence.

       "  'summary': u'  This paper introduces depth estimation from water drops. The key idea is that\\na single water drop adhered to window glass is totally transparent and convex,\\nand thus optically acts like a fisheye lens. If we have more than one water\\ndrop in a single image, then through each of them we can see the environment\\nwith different view points, similar to stereo. To realize this idea, we need to\\nrectify every water drop imagery to make radially distorted planar surfaces\\nlook flat. For this rectification, we consider two physical properties of water\\ndrops: (1) A static water drop has constant volume, and its geometric convex\\nshape is determined by the balance between the tension force and gravity. This\\nimplies that the 3D geometric shape can be obtained by minimizing the overall\\npotential energy, which is the sum of the tension energy and the gravitational\\npotential energy.

This total reflection\\ngenerates a dark band commonly observed in any adherent water drops.

       "  'summary': u'  Deep feedforward and recurrent networks have achieved impressive results in\\nmany perception and language processing applications. This success is partially\\nattributed to architectural innovations such as convolutional and long\\nshort-term memory networks. The main motivation for these architectural\\ninnovations is that they capture better domain knowledge, and importantly are\\neasier to optimize than more basic architectures. Recently, more complex\\narchitectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been\\nproposed for tasks including question answering and general computation,\\ncreating a new set of optimization challenges. In this paper, we discuss a\\nlow-overhead and easy-to-implement technique of adding gradient noise which we\\nfind to be surprisingly effective when training these very deep architectures.\\nThe technique not only helps to avoid overfitting, but also can result in lower\\ntraining loss. This method alone allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network\\nto be trained with standard gradient descent, even starting from a poor\\ninitialization. We see consistent improvements for many complex models,\\nincluding a 72% relative reduction in error rate over a carefully-tuned\\nbaseline on a challenging question-answering task, and a doubling of the number\\nof accurate binary multiplication models learned across 7,000 random restarts.\\nWe encourage further application of this technique to additional complex modern\\narchitectures.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  One of the common artificial intelligence applications in electronic games\\nconsists of making an artificial agent learn how to execute some determined\\ntask successfully in a game environment. One way to perform this task is\\nthrough machine learning algorithms capable of learning the sequence of actions\\nrequired to win in a given game environment. There are several supervised\\nlearning techniques able to learn the correct answer for a problem through\\nexamples. However, when learning how to play electronic games, the correct\\nanswer might only be known by the end of the game, after all the actions were\\nalready taken. Thus, not being possible to measure the accuracy of each\\nindividual action to be taken at each time step. A way for dealing with this\\nproblem is through Neuroevolution, a method which trains Artificial Neural\\nNetworks using evolutionary algorithms. In this article, we introduce a\\nframework for testing optimization algorithms with artificial agent controllers\\nin electronic games, called EvoMan, which is inspired in the action-platformer\\ngame Mega Man II. The environment can be configured to run in different\\nexperiment modes, as single evolution, coevolution and others. To demonstrate\\nsome challenges regarding the proposed platform, as initial experiments we\\napplied Neuroevolution using Genetic Algorithms and the NEAT algorithm, in the\\ncontext of competitively coevolving two distinct agents in this game.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Joint segmentation and classification of fine-grained actions is important\\nfor applications in human-robot interaction, video surveillance, and human\\nskill evaluation. However, despite substantial recent progress in large scale\\naction classification, the performance of state-of-the-art fine-grained action\\nrecognition approaches remains low. In this paper, we propose a new\\nspatio-temporal CNN model for fine-grained action classification and\\nsegmentation, which combines (1) a spatial CNN to represent objects in the\\nscene and their spatial relationships; (2) a temporal CNN that captures how\\nobject relationships within an action change over time; and (3) a semi-Markov\\nmodel that captures transitions from one action to another. In addition, we\\nintroduce an efficient segmental inference algorithm for joint segmentation and\\nclassification of actions that is orders of magnitude faster than\\nstate-of-the-art approaches. We highlight the effectiveness of our approach on\\ncooking and surgical action datasets for which we observe substantially\\nimproved performance relative to recent baseline methods.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u\"  With the accelerated development of robot technologies, optimal control\\nbecomes one of the central themes of research. In traditional approaches, the\\ncontroller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the\\nbasis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions,\\nobjectives, learning schemes, and so on planted into it. The idea is that the\\ncontroller controls the world---the body plus its environment---as reliably as\\npossible. This paper advocates for a new paradigm of control, obtained by\\nmaking the world control its controller in the first place. The paper presents\\na solution with a controller that is devoid of any functionalities of its own,\\ngiven by a fixed, explicit and context-free function of the recent history of\\nthe sensor values. When applying this controller to a muscle-tendon driven\\narm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics toolkit, we observe a vast variety of\\nself-organized behavior patterns: when left alone, the arm realizes\\npseudo-random sequences of different poses but one can also manipulate the\\nsystem into definite motion patterns. But most interestingly, after attaching\\nan object, the controller gets in a functional resonance with the object's\\ninternal dynamics: when given a half-filled bottle, the system spontaneously\\nstarts shaking the bottle so that maximum response from the dynamics of the\\nwater is being generated. After attaching a pendulum to the arm, the controller\\ndrives the pendulum into a circular mode. In this way, the robot discovers\\naffordances of objects its body is interacting with. We also discuss\\nperspectives for using this controller paradigm for intention driven behavior\\ngeneration.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We proposed Neural Enquirer as a neural network architecture to execute a\\nnatural language (NL) query on a knowledge-base (KB) for answers. Basically,\\nNeural Enquirer finds the distributed representation of a query and then\\nexecutes it on knowledge-base tables to obtain the answer as one of the values\\nin the tables. Unlike similar efforts in end-to-end training of semantic\\nparsers, Neural Enquirer is fully \"neuralized\": it not only gives\\ndistributional representation of the query and the knowledge-base, but also\\nrealizes the execution of compositional queries as a series of differentiable\\noperations, with intermediate results (consisting of annotations of the tables\\nat different levels) saved on multiple layers of memory.

       "  'summary': u'  Recent algorithms in convolutional neural networks (CNN) considerably advance\\nthe fine-grained image classification, which aims to differentiate subtle\\ndifferences among subordinate classes. However, previous studies have rarely\\nfocused on learning a fined-grained and structured feature representation that\\nis able to locate similar images at different levels of relevance, e.g.,\\ndiscovering cars from the same make or the same model, both of which require\\nhigh precision. In this paper, we propose two main contributions to tackle this\\nproblem. 1) A multi-task learning framework is designed to effectively learn\\nfine-grained feature representations by jointly optimizing both classification\\nand similarity constraints. 2) To model the multi-level relevance, label\\nstructures such as hierarchy or shared attributes are seamlessly embedded into\\nthe framework by generalizing the triplet loss. Extensive and thorough\\nexperiments have been conducted on three fine-grained datasets, i.e., the\\nStanford car, the car-333, and the food datasets, which contain either\\nhierarchical labels or shared attributes. Our proposed method has achieved very\\ncompetitive performance, i.e., among state-of-the-art classification accuracy.\\nMore importantly, it significantly outperforms previous fine-grained feature\\nrepresentations for image retrieval at different levels of relevance.\\n',\n",

In the context of speech processing, a deep\\nneural network (DNN) is an effective computational method to infer the\\nprobability of individual phonological classes from a short segment of speech\\nsignal. A vector of all phonological class probabilities is referred to as\\nphonological posterior.

       "  'summary': u\"  The complexity of deep neural network algorithms for hardware implementation\\ncan be much lowered by optimizing the word-length of weights and signals.\\nDirect quantization of floating-point weights, however, does not show good\\nperformance when the number of bits assigned is small. Retraining of quantized\\nnetworks has been developed to relieve this problem. In this work, the effects\\nof retraining are analyzed for a feedforward deep neural network (FFDNN) and a\\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). The network complexity is controlled to\\nknow their effects on the resiliency of quantized networks by retraining. The\\ncomplexity of the FFDNN is controlled by varying the unit size in each hidden\\nlayer and the number of layers, while that of the CNN is done by modifying the\\nfeature map configuration. We find that the performance gap between the\\nfloating-point and the retrain-based ternary (+1, 0, -1) weight neural networks\\nexists with a fair amount in 'complexity limited' networks, but the discrepancy\\nalmost vanishes in fully complex networks whose capability is limited by the\\ntraining data, rather than by the number of connections. This research shows\\nthat highly complex DNNs have the capability of absorbing the effects of severe\\nweight quantization through retraining, but connection limited networks are\\nless resilient. This paper also presents the effective compression ratio to\\nguide the trade-off between the network size and the precision when the\\nhardware resource is limited.\\n\",\n",

The local expansion\\nmoves are presented as many alpha-expansions defined for small grid regions.\\nThe local expansion moves extend the traditional expansion moves by two ways:\\nlocalization and spatial propagation. By localization, we use different\\ncandidate alpha-labels according to the locations of local alpha-expansions. By\\nspatial propagation, we design our local alpha-expansions to propagate\\ncurrently assigned labels for nearby regions. With this localization and\\nspatial propagation, our method can efficiently infer Markov random field\\nmodels with a huge or continuous label space using a randomized search scheme.\\nOur local expansion move method has several advantages over previous approaches\\nthat are based on fusion moves or belief propagation; it produces submodular\\nmoves deriving a subproblem optimality; it helps find good, smooth, piecewise\\nlinear disparity maps; it is suitable for parallelization; it can use\\ncost-volume filtering techniques for accelerating the matching cost\\ncomputations.

       "  'summary': u'  Perceptrons are neuronal devices capable of fully discriminating linearly\\nseparable classes. Although straightforward to implement and train, their\\napplicability is usually hindered by non-trivial requirements imposed by\\nreal-world classification problems. Therefore, several approaches, such as\\nkernel perceptrons, have been conceived to counteract such difficulties. In\\nthis paper, we investigate an enhanced perceptron model based on the notion of\\ncontrastive biclusters. From this perspective, a good discriminative bicluster\\ncomprises a subset of data instances belonging to one class that show high\\ncoherence across a subset of features and high differentiation from nearest\\ninstances of the other class under the same features (referred to as its\\ncontrastive bicluster). Upon each local subspace associated with a pair of\\ncontrastive biclusters a perceptron is trained and the model with highest area\\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value is selected as\\nthe final classifier. Experiments conducted on a range of data sets, including\\nthose related to a difficult biosignal classification problem, show that the\\nproposed variant can be indeed very useful, prevailing in most of the cases\\nupon standard and kernel perceptrons in terms of accuracy and AUC measures.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Algorithms for hyperparameter optimization abound, all of which work well\\nunder different and often unverifiable assumptions. Motivated by the general\\nchallenge of sequentially choosing which algorithm to use, we study the more\\nspecific task of choosing among distributions to use for random hyperparameter\\noptimization. This work is naturally framed in the extreme bandit setting,\\nwhich deals with sequentially choosing which distribution from a collection to\\nsample in order to minimize (maximize) the single best cost (reward). Whereas\\nthe distributions in the standard bandit setting are primarily characterized by\\ntheir means, a number of subtleties arise when we care about the minimal cost\\nas opposed to the average cost. For example, there may not be a well-defined\\n\"best\" distribution as there is in the standard bandit setting. The best\\ndistribution depends on the rewards that have been obtained and on the\\nremaining time horizon. Whereas in the standard bandit setting, it is sensible\\nto compare policies with an oracle which plays the single best arm, in the\\nextreme bandit setting, there are multiple sensible oracle models. We define a\\nsensible notion of \"extreme regret\" in the extreme bandit setting, which\\nparallels the concept of regret in the standard bandit setting. We then prove\\nthat no policy can asymptotically achieve no extreme regret.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  The standard approach to compressive sampling considers recovering an unknown\\ndeterministic signal with certain known structure, and designing the\\nsub-sampling pattern and recovery algorithm based on the known structure.

       "  'summary': u'  Nowadays large amounts of GPS trajectory data is being continuously collected\\nby GPS-enabled devices such as vehicles navigation systems and mobile phones.\\nGPS trajectory data is useful for applications such as traffic management,\\nlocation forecasting, and itinerary planning. Such applications often need to\\nextract the time-stamped Sequence of Visited Locations (SVLs) of the mobile\\nobjects. The nearest neighbor query (NNQ) is the most applied method for\\nlabeling the visited locations based on the IDs of the POIs in the process of\\nSVL generation. NNQ in some scenarios is not accurate enough. To improve the\\nquality of the extracted SVLs, instead of using NNQ, we label the visited\\nlocations as the IDs of the POIs which geometrically intersect with the GPS\\nobservations. Intersection operator requires the accurate geometry of the\\npoints of interest which we refer to them as the Geometries of Interest (GOIs).\\nIn some application domains (e.g. movement trajectories of animals), adequate\\ninformation about the POIs and their GOIs may not be available a priori, or\\nthey may not be publicly accessible and, therefore, they need to be derived\\nfrom GPS trajectory data. In this paper we propose a novel method for\\nestimating the POIs and their GOIs, which consists of three phases: (i)\\nextracting the geometries of the stay regions; (ii) constructing the geometry\\nof destination regions based on the extracted stay regions; and (iii)\\nconstructing the GOIs based on the geometries of the destination regions. Using\\nthe geometric similarity to known GOIs as the major evaluation criterion, the\\nexperiments we performed using long-term GPS trajectory data show that our\\nmethod outperforms the existing approaches.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We introduce the concept of unconstrained real-time 3D facial performance\\ncapture through explicit semantic segmentation in the RGB input. To ensure\\nrobustness, cutting edge supervised learning approaches rely on large training\\ndatasets of face images captured in the wild. While impressive tracking quality\\nhas been demonstrated for faces that are largely visible, any occlusion due to\\nhair, accessories, or hand-to-face gestures would result in significant visual\\nartifacts and loss of tracking accuracy. The modeling of occlusions has been\\nmostly avoided due to its immense space of appearance variability. To address\\nthis curse of high dimensionality, we perform tracking in unconstrained images\\nassuming non-face regions can be fully masked out. Along with recent\\nbreakthroughs in deep learning, we demonstrate that pixel-level facial\\nsegmentation is possible in real-time by repurposing convolutional neural\\nnetworks designed originally for general semantic segmentation. We develop an\\nefficient architecture based on a two-stream deconvolution network with\\ncomplementary characteristics, and introduce carefully designed training\\nsamples and data augmentation strategies for improved segmentation accuracy and\\nrobustness. We adopt a state-of-the-art regression-based facial tracking\\nframework with segmented face images as training, and demonstrate accurate and\\nuninterrupted facial performance capture in the presence of extreme occlusion\\nand even side views. Furthermore, the resulting segmentation can be directly\\nused to composite partial 3D face models on the input images and enable\\nseamless facial manipulation tasks, such as virtual make-up or face\\nreplacement.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Sequences have become first class citizens in supervised learning thanks to\\nthe resurgence of recurrent neural networks. Many complex tasks that require\\nmapping from or to a sequence of observations can now be formulated with the\\nsequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) framework which employs the chain rule to\\nefficiently represent the joint probability of sequences. In many cases,\\nhowever, variable sized inputs and/or outputs might not be naturally expressed\\nas sequences.

In this paper, we first show using\\nvarious examples that the order in which we organize input and/or output data\\nmatters significantly when learning an underlying model.

       "  'summary': u'  Most individuals in social networks experience a so-called Friendship\\nParadox: they are less popular than their friends on average. This effect may\\nexplain recent findings that widespread social network media use leads to\\nreduced happiness. However the relation between popularity and happiness is\\npoorly understood. A Friendship paradox does not necessarily imply a Happiness\\nparadox where most individuals are less happy than their friends. Here we\\nreport the first direct observation of a significant Happiness Paradox in a\\nlarge-scale online social network of $39,110$ Twitter users. Our results reveal\\nthat popular individuals are indeed happier and that a majority of individuals\\nexperience a significant Happiness paradox. The magnitude of the latter effect\\nis shaped by complex interactions between individual popularity, happiness, and\\nthe fact that users cluster assortatively by level of happiness. Our results\\nindicate that the topology of online social networks and the distribution of\\nhappiness in some populations can cause widespread psycho-social effects that\\naffect the well-being of billions of individuals.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Single modality action recognition on RGB or depth sequences has been\\nextensively explored recently. It is generally accepted that each of these two\\nmodalities has different strengths and limitations for the task of action\\nrecognition. Therefore, analysis of the RGB+D videos can help us to better\\nstudy the complementary properties of these two types of modalities and achieve\\nhigher levels of performance. In this paper, we propose a new deep autoencoder\\nbased shared-specific feature factorization network to separate input\\nmultimodal signals into a hierarchy of components. Further, based on the\\nstructure of the features, a structured sparsity learning machine is proposed\\nwhich utilizes mixed norms to apply regularization within components and group\\nselection between them for better classification performance. Our experimental\\nresults show the effectiveness of our cross-modality feature analysis framework\\nby achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for action classification on four\\nchallenging benchmark datasets, for which we reduce the error rate by more than\\n40% in three datasets and saturating the benchmark with perfect accuracy for\\nthe other one.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  The back-propagation algorithm is widely used for learning in artificial\\nneural networks. A challenge in machine learning is to create models that\\ngeneralize to new data samples not seen in the training data. Recently, a\\ncommon flaw in several machine learning algorithms was discovered: small\\nperturbations added to the input data lead to consistent misclassification of\\ndata samples. Samples that easily mislead the model are called adversarial\\nexamples. Training a \"maxout\" network on adversarial examples has shown to\\ndecrease this vulnerability, but also increase classification performance. This\\npaper shows that adversarial training has a regularizing effect also in\\nnetworks with logistic, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. A simple\\nextension to the back-propagation method is proposed, that adds an adversarial\\ngradient to the training. The extension requires an additional forward and\\nbackward pass to calculate a modified input sample, or mini batch, used as\\ninput for standard back-propagation learning. The first experimental results on\\nMNIST show that the \"adversarial back-propagation\" method increases the\\nresistance to adversarial examples and boosts the classification performance.\\nThe extension reduces the classification error on the permutation invariant\\nMNIST from 1.60% to 0.95% in a logistic network, and from 1.40% to 0.78% in a\\nnetwork with rectified linear units. Results on CIFAR-10 indicate that the\\nmethod has a regularizing effect similar to dropout in fully connected\\nnetworks. Based on these promising results, adversarial back-propagation is\\nproposed as a stand-alone regularizing method that should be further\\ninvestigated.\\n',\n",

In this work we show a systematic design for how\\nconvolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for\\nlearning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose\\nestimation. The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range\\ndependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as\\narticulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential\\narchitecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief\\nmaps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part\\nlocations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference. Our\\napproach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during\\ntraining by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces\\nintermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and\\nconditioning the learning procedure.

       "  'summary': u'  This paper presents a new Bayesian estimation technique for hidden\\nPotts-Markov random fields with unknown regularisation parameters, with\\napplication to fast unsupervised K-class image segmentation. The technique is\\nderived by first removing the regularisation parameter from the Bayesian model\\nby marginalisation, followed by a small-variance-asymptotic (SVA) analysis in\\nwhich the spatial regularisation and the integer-constrained terms of the Potts\\nmodel are decoupled. The evaluation of this SVA Bayesian estimator is then\\nrelaxed into a problem that can be computed efficiently by iteratively solving\\na convex total-variation denoising problem and a least-squares clustering\\n(K-means) problem, both of which can be solved straightforwardly, even in\\nhigh-dimensions, and with parallel computing techniques. This leads to a fast\\nfully unsupervised Bayesian image segmentation methodology in which the\\nstrength of the spatial regularisation is adapted automatically to the observed\\nimage during the inference procedure, and that can be easily applied in large\\n2D and 3D scenarios or in applications requiring low computing times.\\nExperimental results on real images, as well as extensive comparisons with\\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, confirm that the proposed methodology offer\\nextremely fast convergence and produces accurate segmentation results, with the\\nimportant additional advantage of self-adjusting regularisation parameters.\\n',\n",

We show that this relationship is the result of a misspecified model\\nthat does not consider the temporal aspect of the data by presenting a similar\\nbut nonsensical relationship between the global annual mean sea level and\\nlexical diversity. Given the fact that in the recent past, several studies were\\npublished that present surprising links between different economic, cultural,\\npolitical and (socio-)demographical variables on the one hand and cultural or\\nlinguistic characteristics on the other hand, but seem to suffer from exactly\\nthis problem, we explain the cause of the misspecification and show that it has\\nprofound consequences.

       "  'summary': u'  Recent works on interactive video object cutout mainly focus on designing\\ndynamic foreground-background (FB) classifiers for segmentation propagation.\\nHowever, the research on optimally removing errors from the FB classification\\nis sparse, and the errors often accumulate rapidly, causing significant errors\\nin the propagated frames. In this work, we take the initial steps to addressing\\nthis problem, and we call this new task \\\\emph{segmentation rectification}. Our\\nkey observation is that the possibly asymmetrically distributed false positive\\nand false negative errors were handled equally in the conventional methods. We,\\nalternatively, propose to optimally remove these two types of errors. To this\\neffect, we propose a novel bilayer Markov Random Field (MRF) model for this new\\ntask. We also adopt the well-established structured learning framework to learn\\nthe optimal model from data. Additionally, we propose a novel one-class\\nstructured SVM (OSSVM) which greatly speeds up the structured learning process.\\nOur method naturally extends to RGB-D videos as well. Comprehensive experiments\\non both RGB and RGB-D data demonstrate that our simple and effective method\\nsignificantly outperforms the segmentation propagation methods adopted in the\\nstate-of-the-art video cutout systems, and the results also suggest the\\npotential usefulness of our method in image cutout system.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves\\nminimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces.\\nGradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to\\nperform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of\\ndifficulty for the ability of these local methods to find the global minimum is\\nthe proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global\\nminimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random\\nmatrix theory, and neural network theory, that a deeper and more profound\\ndifficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local\\nminima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such\\nsaddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow\\ndown learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local\\nminimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new algorithm, the\\nsaddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle\\npoints, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods.

       "  'summary': u\"  In theoretical cognitive science, there is a tension between highly\\nstructured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation\\nand highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations\\nare difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into\\ncognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently\\nsurfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning\\napproach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of\\nexercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT---has demonstrated a stunning\\nperformance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge\\ntracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT's\\nadvantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that\\nDKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity\\nthat BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence,\\ninter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate\\nthat when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical\\nregularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---BKT\\nachieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue\\nthat while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling\\nstudent learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel\\nrepresentations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the\\nquestion posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not\\nrequire `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us\\ngreater interpretability and explanatory power.\\n\",\n",

However, the backward pass usually needs to consume\\nunaffordable memory to store all the intermediate variables to exactly reverse\\nthe forward training procedure. In this work we propose a simple but effective\\nmethod, DrMAD, to distill the knowledge of the forward pass into a shortcut\\npath, through which we approximately reverse the training trajectory.\\nExperiments on several image benchmark datasets show that DrMAD is at least 45\\ntimes faster and consumes 100 times less memory compared to state-of-the-art\\nmethods for optimizing hyperparameters with minimal compromise to its\\neffectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, DrMAD is the first research\\nattempt to make it practical to automatically tune thousands of hyperparameters\\nof deep neural networks.

       "  'summary': u'  Active learning (AL) is a learning paradigm where an active learner has to\\ntrain a model (e.g., a classifier) which is in principal trained in a\\nsupervised way, but in AL it has to be done by means of a data set with\\ninitially unlabeled samples. To get labels for these samples, the active\\nlearner has to ask an oracle (e.g., a human expert) for labels. The goal is to\\nmaximize the performance of the model and to minimize the number of queries at\\nthe same time. In this article, we first briefly discuss the state of the art\\nand own, preliminary work in the field of AL. Then, we propose the concept of\\ncollaborative active learning (CAL). With CAL, we will overcome some of the\\nharsh limitations of current AL.

       "  'summary': u'  Extracting a connectome from an electron microscopy (EM) data set requires\\nidentification of neurons and determination of synapses between neurons. As\\nmanual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been\\nextensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide\\nand eventually replace manual tracing. Until recently, there has been\\ncomparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses\\nbetween neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several\\nfactors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a\\nconnectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating\\nsynapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in\\ndetermining connections.\\n  However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a\\nsufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has\\nimproved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more\\nsignificant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get\\nworse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we\\naddress this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect\\npre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,\\npre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive\\nNetwork, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features\\nconditioned on the local segmentation.\\n  This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages\\nadvances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for\\npolyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our\\nalgorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that\\ncomplete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most\\nconnectivity correctly.\\n',\n",

We formally prove that these networks with random Gaussian weights\\nperform a distance-preserving embedding of the data, with a special treatment\\nfor in-class and out-of-class data. Similar points at the input of the network\\nare likely to have a similar output. The theoretical analysis of deep networks\\nhere presented exploits tools used in the compressed sensing and dictionary\\nlearning literature, thereby making a formal connection between these important\\ntopics. The derived results allow drawing conclusions on the metric learning\\nproperties of the network and their relation to its structure, as well as\\nproviding bounds on the required size of the training set such that the\\ntraining examples would represent faithfully the unseen data. The results are\\nvalidated with state-of-the-art trained networks.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  A novel global energy model for multi-class semantic image segmentation is\\nproposed that admits very efficient exact inference and derivative calculations\\nfor learning. Inference in this model is equivalent to MAP inference in a\\nparticular kind of vector-valued Gaussian Markov random field, and ultimately\\nreduces to solving a linear system of linear PDEs known as a reaction-diffusion\\nsystem. Solving this system can be achieved in time scaling near-linearly in\\nthe number of image pixels by reducing it to sequential FFTs, after a linear\\nchange of basis. The efficiency and differentiability of the model make it\\nespecially well-suited for integration with convolutional neural networks, even\\nallowing it to be used in interior, feature-generating layers and stacked\\nmultiple times.

       "  'summary': u'  The emergence of collective dynamics in neural networks is a mechanism of the\\nanimal and human brain for information processing. In this paper, we develop a\\ncomputational technique of distributed processing elements, which are called\\nparticles. We observe the collective dynamics of particles in a complex network\\nfor transductive inference on semi-supervised learning problems. Three actions\\ngovern the particles\\' dynamics: walking, absorption, and generation. Labeled\\nvertices generate new particles that compete against rival particles for edge\\ndomination. Active particles randomly walk in the network until they are\\nabsorbed by either a rival vertex or an edge currently dominated by rival\\nparticles. The result from the model simulation consists of sets of edges\\nsorted by the label dominance. Each set tends to form a connected subnetwork to\\nrepresent a data class. Although the intrinsic dynamics of the model is a\\nstochastic one, we prove there exists a deterministic version with largely\\nreduced computational complexity; specifically, with subquadratic growth.\\nFurthermore, the edge domination process corresponds to an unfolding map.\\nIntuitively, edges \"stretch\" and \"shrink\" according to edge dynamics.\\nConsequently, such effect summarizes the relevant relationships between\\nvertices and uncovered data classes. The proposed model captures important\\ndetails of connectivity patterns over the edge dynamics evolution, which\\ncontrasts with previous approaches focused on vertex dynamics. Computer\\nsimulations reveal that our model can identify nonlinear features in both real\\nand artificial data, including boundaries between distinct classes and the\\noverlapping structure of data.\\n',\n",

In this paper, we present a\\nfast method for accurately tracking rapid and complex articulations of the hand\\nusing a single depth camera. Our algorithm uses a novel detection-guided\\noptimization strategy that increases the robustness and speed of pose\\nestimation. In the detection step, a randomized decision forest classifies\\npixels into parts of the hand. In the optimization step, a novel objective\\nfunction combines the detected part labels and a Gaussian mixture\\nrepresentation of the depth to estimate a pose that best fits the depth. Our\\napproach needs comparably less computational resources which makes it extremely\\nfast (50 fps without GPU support). The approach also supports varying static,\\nor moving, camera-to-scene arrangements. We show the benefits of our method by\\nevaluating on public datasets and comparing against previous work.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Node similarity is a fundamental problem in graph analytics. However, node\\nsimilarity between nodes in different graphs (inter-graph nodes) has not\\nreceived a lot of attention yet. The inter-graph node similarity is important\\nin learning a new graph based on the knowledge of an existing graph (transfer\\nlearning on graphs) and has applications in biological, communication, and\\nsocial networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distance function for\\nmeasuring inter-graph node similarity with edit distance, called NED. In NED,\\ntwo nodes are compared according to their local neighborhood structures which\\nare represented as unordered k-adjacent trees, without relying on labels or\\nother assumptions. Since the computation problem of tree edit distance on\\nunordered trees is NP-Complete, we propose a modified tree edit distance,\\ncalled TED*, for comparing neighborhood trees. TED* is a metric distance, as\\nthe original tree edit distance, but more importantly, TED* is polynomially\\ncomputable. As a metric distance, NED admits efficient indexing, provides\\ninterpretable results, and shows to perform better than existing approaches on\\na number of data analysis tasks, including graph de-anonymization. Finally, the\\nefficiency and effectiveness of NED are empirically demonstrated using\\nreal-world graphs.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We consider the problem of depth estimation from a single monocular image in\\nthis work. It is a challenging task as no reliable depth cues are available,\\ne.g., stereo correspondences, motions, etc. Previous efforts have been focusing\\non exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, with all\\nusing hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features\\nfrom deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for\\nvarious vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous\\ncharacteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally\\nformulated into a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem.\\nTherefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural field model for\\nestimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity\\nof deep CNN and continuous CRF. Specifically, we propose a deep structured\\nlearning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous\\nCRF in a unified deep CNN framework.\\n  The proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with\\nno geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In our case, the\\nintegral of the partition function can be analytically calculated, thus we can\\nexactly solve the log-likelihood optimization. Moreover, solving the MAP\\nproblem for predicting depths of a new image is highly efficient as closed-form\\nsolutions exist. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method\\noutperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on both indoor and\\noutdoor scene datasets.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Recently, deep learning techniques have enjoyed success in various multimedia\\napplications, such as image classification and multi-modal data analysis. Large\\ndeep learning models are developed for learning rich representations of complex\\ndata. There are two challenges to overcome before deep learning can be widely\\nadopted in multimedia and other applications. One is usability, namely the\\nimplementation of different models and training algorithms must be done by\\nnon-experts without much effort especially when the model is large and complex.\\nThe other is scalability, that is the deep learning system must be able to\\nprovision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large models\\nwith massive datasets. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we\\ndesign a distributed deep learning platform called SINGA which has an intuitive\\nprogramming model based on the common layer abstraction of deep learning\\nmodels. Good scalability is achieved through flexible distributed training\\narchitecture and specific optimization techniques. SINGA runs on GPUs as well\\nas on CPUs, and we show that it outperforms many other state-of-the-art deep\\nlearning systems. Our experience with developing and training deep learning\\nmodels for real-life multimedia applications in SINGA shows that the platform\\nis both usable and scalable.\\n',\n",

The algorithm learns the competence of each labeller by\\ncomparing her labels to those of other labellers on the same tasks and uses\\nthis information to minimize the prediction error rate on each task. We provide\\nperformance guarantees of our algorithm for a fixed population of independent\\nlabellers. In particular, we show that our algorithm is optimal in the sense\\nthat the cumulative regret compared to the optimal decision with known labeller\\nerror probabilities is finite, independently of the number of tasks to label.\\nThe complexity of the algorithm is linear in the number of labellers and the\\nnumber of tasks, up to some logarithmic factors. Numerical experiments\\nillustrate the performance of our algorithm compared to existing algorithms,\\nincluding simple majority voting and expectation-maximization algorithms, on\\nboth synthetic and real datasets.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  In this work, we analyze the utility of two dimensional document maps for\\nexploratory analysis of Polish case law. We start by comparing two methods of\\ngenerating such visualizations. First is based on linear principal component\\nanalysis (PCA). Second makes use of the modern nonlinear t-Distributed\\nStochastic Neighbor Embedding method (t-SNE). We apply both PCA and t-SNE to a\\ncorpus of judgments from different courts in Poland. It emerges that t-SNE\\nprovides better, more interpretable results than PCA. As a next test, we apply\\nt-SNE to randomly selected sample of common court judgments corresponding to\\ndifferent keywords. We show that t-SNE, in this case, reveals hidden topical\\nstructure of the documents related to keyword,,pension\". In conclusion, we find\\nthat the t-SNE method could be a promising tool to facilitate the exploitative\\nanalysis of legal texts, e.g., by complementing search or browse functionality\\nin legal databases.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Breast cancer screening policies attempt to achieve timely diagnosis by the\\nregular screening of apparently healthy women. Various clinical decisions are\\nneeded to manage the screening process; those include: selecting the screening\\ntests for a woman to take, interpreting the test outcomes, and deciding whether\\nor not a woman should be referred to a diagnostic test. Such decisions are\\ncurrently guided by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which represent a\\none-size-fits-all approach that are designed to work well on average for a\\npopulation, without guaranteeing that it will work well uniformly over that\\npopulation. Since the risks and benefits of screening are functions of each\\npatients features, personalized screening policies that are tailored to the\\nfeatures of individuals are needed in order to ensure that the right tests are\\nrecommended to the right woman. In order to address this issue, we present\\nConfidentCare: a computer-aided clinical decision support system that learns a\\npersonalized screening policy from the electronic health record (EHR) data.\\nConfidentCare operates by recognizing clusters of similar patients, and\\nlearning the best screening policy to adopt for each cluster.

       "  'summary': u'  Physicists use quantum models to describe the behavior of physical systems.\\nQuantum models owe their success to their interpretability, to their relation\\nto probabilistic models (quantization of classical models) and to their high\\npredictive power. Beyond physics, these properties are valuable in general data\\nscience. This motivates the use of quantum models to analyze general\\nnonphysical datasets. Here we provide both empirical and theoretical insights\\ninto the application of quantum models in data science. In the theoretical part\\nof this paper, we firstly show that quantum models can be exponentially more\\nefficient than probabilistic models because there exist datasets that admit\\nlow-dimensional quantum models and only exponentially high-dimensional\\nprobabilistic models. Secondly, we explain in what sense quantum models realize\\na useful relaxation of compressed probabilistic models. Thirdly, we show that\\nsparse datasets admit low-dimensional quantum models and finally, we introduce\\na method to compute hierarchical orderings of properties of users (e.g.,\\npersonality traits) and items (e.g., genres of movies). In the empirical part\\nof the paper, we evaluate quantum models in item recommendation and observe\\nthat the predictive power of quantum-inspired recommender systems can compete\\nwith state-of-the-art recommender systems like SVD++ and PureSVD. Furthermore,\\nwe make use of the interpretability of quantum models by computing hierarchical\\norderings of properties of users and items. This work establishes a connection\\nbetween data science (item recommendation), information theory (communication\\ncomplexity), mathematical programming (positive semidefinite factorizations)\\nand physics (quantum models).\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Multilayered artificial neural networks (ANN) have found widespread utility\\nin classification and recognition applications. The scale and complexity of\\nsuch networks together with the inadequacies of general purpose computing\\nplatforms have led to a significant interest in the development of efficient\\nhardware implementations. In this work, we focus on designing energy efficient\\non-chip storage for the synaptic weights. In order to minimize the power\\nconsumption of typical digital CMOS implementations of such large-scale\\nnetworks, the digital neurons could be operated reliably at scaled voltages by\\nreducing the clock frequency. On the contrary, the on-chip synaptic storage\\ndesigned using a conventional 6T SRAM is susceptible to bitcell failures at\\nreduced voltages. However, the intrinsic error resiliency of NNs to small\\nsynaptic weight perturbations enables us to scale the operating voltage of the\\n6TSRAM. Our analysis on a widely used digit recognition dataset indicates that\\nthe voltage can be scaled by 200mV from the nominal operating voltage (950mV)\\nfor practically no loss (less than 0.5%) in accuracy (22nm predictive\\ntechnology). Scaling beyond that causes substantial performance degradation\\nowing to increased probability of failures in the MSBs of the synaptic weights.\\nWe, therefore propose a significance driven hybrid 8T-6T SRAM, wherein the\\nsensitive MSBs are stored in 8T bitcells that are robust at scaled voltages due\\nto decoupled read and write paths. In an effort to further minimize the area\\npenalty, we present a synaptic-sensitivity driven hybrid memory architecture\\nconsisting of multiple 8T-6T SRAM banks. Our circuit to system-level simulation\\nframework shows that the proposed synaptic-sensitivity driven architecture\\nprovides a 30.91% reduction in the memory access power with a 10.41% area\\noverhead, for less than 1% loss in the classification accuracy.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  The Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm uses a conditional\\nGaus-sian Process (GP) to approximate an objective function known at a finite\\nnumber of observation points and sequentially adds new points which maximize\\nthe Expected Improvement criterion according to the GP. The important factor\\nthat controls the efficiency of EGO is the GP covariance function (or kernel)\\nwhich should be chosen according to the objective function. Traditionally, a\\npa-rameterized family of covariance functions is considered whose parameters\\nare learned through statistical procedures such as maximum likelihood or\\ncross-validation. However, it may be questioned whether statistical procedures\\nfor learning covariance functions are the most efficient for optimization as\\nthey target a global agreement between the GP and the observations which is not\\nthe ultimate goal of optimization. Furthermore, statistical learning procedures\\nare computationally expensive. The main alternative to the statistical learning\\nof the GP is self-adaptation, where the algorithm tunes the kernel parameters\\nbased on their contribution to objective function improvement. After\\nquestioning the possibility of self-adaptation for kriging based optimizers,\\nthis paper proposes a novel approach for tuning the length-scale of the GP in\\nEGO: At each iteration, a small ensemble of kriging models structured by their\\nlength-scales is created.

       "  'summary': u'  Real-time marker-less hand tracking is of increasing importance in\\nhuman-computer interaction. Robust and accurate tracking of arbitrary hand\\nmotion is a challenging problem due to the many degrees of freedom, frequent\\nself-occlusions, fast motions, and uniform skin color. In this paper, we\\npropose a new approach that tracks the full skeleton motion of the hand from\\nmultiple RGB cameras in real-time. The main contributions include a new\\ngenerative tracking method which employs an implicit hand shape representation\\nbased on Sum of Anisotropic Gaussians (SAG), and a pose fitting energy that is\\nsmooth and analytically differentiable making fast gradient based pose\\noptimization possible. This shape representation, together with a full\\nperspective projection model, enables more accurate hand modeling than a\\nrelated baseline method from literature. Our method achieves better accuracy\\nthan previous methods and runs at 25 fps. We show these improvements both\\nqualitatively and quantitatively on publicly available datasets.\\n',\n",

It was of special interest to distinguish messages that\\nconstructively contribute to a discussion from those that are detrimental to\\nthem. Thereby, we wanted to determine whether \"I\"- and \"You\"-messages are\\nindicators for either of the two discussion styles. These messages are nowadays\\noften used in guidelines for successful communication. Although their effects\\nhave been successfully evaluated multiple times, a large-scale analysis has\\nnever been conducted.\\n  Thus, we used Wikipedia Articles for Deletion (short: AfD) discussions\\ntogether with the records of blocked users and developed a fully automated\\ncreation of an annotated data set. In this data set, messages were labelled\\neither constructive or disruptive. We applied binary classifiers to the data to\\ndetermine characteristic words for both discussion styles. Thereby, we also\\ninvestigated whether function words like pronouns and conjunctions play an\\nimportant role in distinguishing the two.\\n  We found that \"You\"-messages were a strong indicator for disruptive messages\\nwhich matches their attributed effects on communication. However, we found\\n\"I\"-messages to be indicative for disruptive messages as well which is contrary\\nto their attributed effects. The importance of function words could neither be\\nconfirmed nor refuted. Other characteristic words for either communication\\nstyle were not found.

In this paper we present a system,\\ncalled FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact\\nEuclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face\\nsimilarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition,\\nverification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques\\nwith FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors.\\n  Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the\\nembedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous\\ndeep learning approaches.

       "  'summary': u'  The Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm is the method of choice for efficient dense\\nimage and object alignment. The approach is efficient as it attempts to model\\nthe connection between appearance and geometric displacement through a linear\\nrelationship that assumes independence across pixel coordinates. A drawback of\\nthe approach, however, is its generative nature. Specifically, its performance\\nis tightly coupled with how well the linear model can synthesize appearance\\nfrom geometric displacement, even though the alignment task itself is\\nassociated with the inverse problem. In this paper, we present a new approach,\\nreferred to as the Conditional LK algorithm, which: (i) directly learns linear\\nmodels that predict geometric displacement as a function of appearance, and\\n(ii) employs a novel strategy for ensuring that the generative pixel\\nindependence assumption can still be taken advantage of. We demonstrate that\\nour approach exhibits superior performance to classical generative forms of the\\nLK algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate its comparable performance to\\nstate-of-the-art methods such as the Supervised Descent Method with\\nsubstantially less training examples, as well as the unique ability to \"swap\"\\ngeometric warp functions without having to retrain from scratch. Finally, from\\na theoretical perspective, our approach hints at possible redundancies that\\nexist in current state-of-the-art methods for alignment that could be leveraged\\nin vision systems of the future.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Tracking many vehicles in wide coverage aerial imagery is crucial for\\nunderstanding events in a large field of view. Most approaches aim to associate\\ndetections from frame differencing into tracks. However, slow or stopped\\nvehicles result in long-term missing detections and further cause tracking\\ndiscontinuities. Relying merely on appearance clue to recover missing\\ndetections is difficult as targets are extremely small and in grayscale. In\\nthis paper, we address the limitations of detection association methods by\\ncoupling it with a local context tracker (LCT), which does not rely on motion\\ndetections. On one hand, our LCT learns neighboring spatial relation and tracks\\neach target in consecutive frames using graph optimization. It takes the\\nadvantage of context constraints to avoid drifting to nearby targets. We\\ngenerate hypotheses from sparse and dense flow efficiently to keep solutions\\ntractable. On the other hand, we use detection association strategy to extract\\nshort tracks in batch processing. We explicitly handle merged detections by\\ngenerating additional hypotheses from them.

       "  'summary': u'  Corpora and web texts can become a rich language learning resource if we have\\na means of assessing whether they are linguistically appropriate for learners\\nat a given proficiency level. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by\\npresenting the first approach for predicting linguistic complexity for Swedish\\nsecond language learning material on a 5-point scale. After showing that the\\ntraditional Swedish readability measure, L\\\\\"asbarhetsindex (LIX), is not\\nsuitable for this task, we propose a supervised machine learning model, based\\non a range of linguistic features, that can reliably classify texts according\\nto their difficulty level. Our model obtained an accuracy of 81.3% and an\\nF-score of 0.8, which is comparable to the state of the art in English and is\\nconsiderably higher than previously reported results for other languages. We\\nfurther studied the utility of our features with single sentences instead of\\nfull texts since sentences are a common linguistic unit in language learning\\nexercises. We trained a separate model on sentence-level data with five\\nclasses, which yielded 63.4% accuracy. Although this is lower than the document\\nlevel performance, we achieved an adjacent accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, we\\nfound that using a combination of different features, compared to using lexical\\nfeatures alone, resulted in 7% improvement in classification accuracy at the\\nsentence level, whereas at the document level, lexical features were more\\ndominant. Our models are intended for use in a freely accessible web-based\\nlanguage learning platform for the automatic generation of exercises.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Current learning-based robot grasping approaches exploit human-labeled\\ndatasets for training the models. However, there are two problems with such a\\nmethodology: (a) since each object can be grasped in multiple ways, manually\\nlabeling grasp locations is not a trivial task; (b) human labeling is biased by\\nsemantics. While there have been attempts to train robots using trial-and-error\\nexperiments, the amount of data used in such experiments remains substantially\\nlow and hence makes the learner prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we take\\nthe leap of increasing the available training data to 40 times more than prior\\nwork, leading to a dataset size of 50K data points collected over 700 hours of\\nrobot grasping attempts. This allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN) for the task of predicting grasp locations without severe overfitting.

       "  'summary': u'  We study methods for aggregating pairwise comparison data in order to\\nestimate outcome probabilities for future comparisons among a collection of n\\nitems. Working within a flexible framework that imposes only a form of strong\\nstochastic transitivity (SST), we introduce an adaptivity index defined by the\\nindifference sets of the pairwise comparison probabilities. In addition to\\nmeasuring the usual worst-case risk of an estimator, this adaptivity index also\\ncaptures the extent to which the estimator adapts to instance-specific\\ndifficulty relative to an oracle estimator. We prove three main results that\\ninvolve this adaptivity index and different algorithms. First, we propose a\\nthree-step estimator termed Count-Randomize-Least squares (CRL), and show that\\nit has adaptivity index upper bounded as $\\\\sqrt{n}$ up to logarithmic factors.\\nWe then show that that conditional on the hardness of planted clique, no\\ncomputationally efficient estimator can achieve an adaptivity index smaller\\nthan $\\\\sqrt{n}$. Second, we show that a regularized least squares estimator can\\nachieve a poly-logarithmic adaptivity index, thereby demonstrating a\\n$\\\\sqrt{n}$-gap between optimal and computationally achievable adaptivity.\\nFinally, we prove that the standard least squares estimator, which is known to\\nbe optimally adaptive in several closely related problems, fails to adapt in\\nthe context of estimating pairwise probabilities.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  The morphology of glands has been used routinely by pathologists to assess\\nthe malignancy degree of adenocarcinomas. Accurate segmentation of glands from\\nhistology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphological statistics\\nfor quantitative diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed an efficient deep\\ncontour-aware network (DCAN) to solve this challenging problem under a unified\\nmulti-task learning framework. In the proposed network, multi-level contextual\\nfeatures from the hierarchical architecture are explored with auxiliary\\nsupervision for accurate gland segmentation. When incorporated with multi-task\\nregularization during the training, the discriminative capability of\\nintermediate features can be further improved. Moreover, our network can not\\nonly output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours\\nsimultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland\\nsegmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied\\nto large-scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to\\ngenerate contours based on low-level cues for post-separating.

We\\nverified it on a number of tasks including long addition and long\\nmultiplication of numbers represented in binary. We train the Neural GPU on\\nnumbers with upto 20 bits and observe no errors whatsoever while testing it,\\neven on much longer numbers.\\n  To achieve these results we introduce a technique for training deep recurrent\\nnetworks: parameter sharing relaxation.

The new rule changes a synaptic weight in proportion to the product of\\nthe presynaptic firing rate and the temporal rate of change of activity on the\\npostsynaptic side.

       "  'summary': u'  It is often desirable to be able to recognize when inputs to a recognition\\nfunction correspond to classes unseen at training time. With this ability,\\nthese inputs could be re-labeled by a human, and later incorporated into the\\nrecognition function -- ideally under an efficient incremental update\\nmechanism. While good models that assume inputs from a fixed set of classes\\nexist, e.g., artificial neural networks and kernel machines, it is not\\nimmediately obvious how to extend them to perform incremental learning in the\\npresence of unknown query classes. Models that do so take little other\\ndistributional information into account when constructing recognition functions\\nand lack strong theoretical foundations. We take steps to address this gap by\\nformulating a novel, theoretically grounded classifier -- the Extreme Value\\nMachine (EVM) -- which is capable of performing open world recognition. The EVM\\nhas a well-grounded interpretation derived from statistical extreme value\\ntheory (EVT), and is the first classifier of its kind to be able to perform\\nnonlinear, kernel-free, variable bandwidth, incremental learning. We\\ndemonstrate experimentally that, compared to other classifiers in the same deep\\nnetwork derived feature space, the EVM is accurate and efficient on an\\nestablished benchmark partition of the ImageNet dataset.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  By Emerging huge databases and the need to efficient learning algorithms on\\nthese datasets, new problems have appeared and some methods have been proposed\\nto solve these problems by selecting efficient features. Feature selection is a\\nproblem of finding efficient features among all features in which the final\\nfeature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. One way to solve this\\nproblem is to evaluate all possible feature subsets. However, evaluating all\\npossible feature subsets is an exhaustive search and thus it has high\\ncomputational complexity. Until now many heuristic algorithms have been studied\\nfor solving this problem. Hyper-heuristic is a new heuristic approach which can\\nsearch the solution space effectively by applying local searches appropriately.\\nEach local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm. Since each region of\\nthe solution space can have its own characteristics, it should be chosen an\\nappropriate local search and apply it to current solution. This task is tackled\\nto a supervisor. The supervisor chooses a local search based on the functional\\nhistory of local searches. By doing this task, it can trade of between\\nexploitation and exploration. Since the existing heuristic cannot trade of\\nbetween exploration and exploitation appropriately, the solution space has not\\nbeen searched appropriately in these methods and thus they have low convergence\\nrate. For the first time, in this paper use a hyper-heuristic approach to find\\nan efficient feature subset. In the proposed method, genetic algorithm is used\\nas a supervisor and 16 heuristic algorithms are used as local searches.\\nEmpirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from\\nUCI data sets indicates that it outperforms recent existing methods in the\\nliterature for feature selection.\\n',\n",

Such models are the key ingredients to\\nautomatically publish the data into knowledge graphs. Manually modeling the\\nsemantics of data sources requires significant effort and expertise, and\\nalthough desirable, building these models automatically is a challenging\\nproblem.

Given some sample data from the new source, we leverage\\nthe knowledge in the domain ontology and the known semantic models to construct\\na weighted graph that represents the space of plausible semantic models for the\\nnew source. Then, we compute the top k candidate semantic models and suggest to\\nthe user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source.

       "  'summary': u'  Fisher vector has been widely used in many multimedia retrieval and visual\\nrecognition applications with good performance. However, the computation\\ncomplexity prevents its usage in real-time video monitoring. In this work, we\\nproposed and implemented GPU-FV, a fast Fisher vector extraction method with\\nthe help of modern GPUs. The challenge of implementing Fisher vector on GPUs\\nlies in the data dependency in feature extraction and expensive memory access\\nin Fisher vector computing. To handle these challenges, we carefully designed\\nGPU-FV in a way that utilizes the computing power of GPU as much as possible,\\nand applied optimizations such as loop tiling to boost the performance. GPU-FV\\nis about 12 times faster than the CPU version, and 50\\\\% faster than a\\nnon-optimized GPU implementation. For standard video input (320*240), GPU-FV\\ncan process each frame within 34ms on a model GPU. Our experiments show that\\nGPU-FV obtains a similar recognition accuracy as traditional FV on VOC 2007 and\\nCaltech 256 image sets. We also applied GPU-FV for realtime video monitoring\\ntasks and found that GPU-FV outperforms a number of previous works.

Combination of these two brain pathways\\nis done by considering each feature sets in Gaussian membership functions with\\nfuzzy product inference method. Two configurations have been proposed for form\\npathway: applying multi-prototype human action templates using two time\\nsynergetic neural network for obtaining uniform template regarding each\\nactions, and second scenario that it uses abstracting human action in four\\nkey-frames.

Most important, we handle real-world scenes\\nconsisting of multiple objects of unknown materials, which necessitates the\\nmodeling of spatially-varying complex reflectance, natural illumination,\\ntexture, interreflection and shadows. We systematically evaluate the\\neffectiveness of our method on synthetic scenes and demonstrate its application\\nto real-world scenes. The results show that rich radiometric information can be\\nrecovered from RGB-D images and demonstrate a new role RGB-D sensors can play\\nfor general scene understanding tasks.\\n',\n",

Our best proposal,\\nnamed DeepBIQ, estimates the image quality by average pooling the scores\\npredicted on multiple sub-regions of the original image.

Experimental results on the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality\\nChallenge Database and on the LIVE Image Quality Assessment Database show that\\nDeepBIQ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods compared, having a Linear\\nCorrelation Coefficient (LCC) with human subjective scores of almost 0.91 and\\n0.98 respectively.

       "  'summary': u'  It is proven that encoding images and videos through Symmetric Positive\\nDefinite (SPD) matrices, and considering the Riemannian geometry of the\\nresulting space, can lead to increased classification performance. Taking into\\naccount manifold geometry is typically done via embedding the manifolds in\\ntangent spaces, or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Recently, it was\\nshown that embedding such manifolds into a Random Projection Spaces (RPS),\\nrather than RKHS or tangent space, leads to higher classification and\\nclustering performance. However, based on structure and dimensionality of the\\nrandomly generated hyperplanes, the classification performance over RPS may\\nvary significantly. In addition, fine-tuning RPS is data expensive (as it\\nrequires validation-data), time consuming, and resource demanding. In this\\npaper, we introduce an approach to learn an optimized kernel-based projection\\n(with fixed dimensionality), by employing the concept of subspace clustering.\\nAs such, we encode the association of data points to the underlying subspace of\\neach point, to generate meaningful hyperplanes. Further, we adopt the concept\\nof dictionary learning and sparse coding, and discriminative analysis, for the\\noptimized kernel-based projection space (OPS) on SPD manifolds. We validate our\\nalgorithm on several classification tasks. The experiment results also\\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\\nsuch manifolds.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u\"  How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many NLP tasks such\\nas answer selection (AS), paraphrase identification (PI) and textual entailment\\n(TE). Most prior work (i) deals with one individual task by fine-tuning a\\nspecific system; (ii) models each sentence's representation separately, rarely\\nconsidering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on manually\\ndesigned, task-specific linguistic features. This work presents a general\\nAttention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair of\\nsentences. We make three contributions. (i) ABCNN can be applied to a wide\\nvariety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs. (ii) We propose three\\nattention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into CNN;\\nthus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its\\ncounterpart.

During training, image clusters and representations are\\nupdated jointly: image clustering is conducted in the forward pass, while\\nrepresentation learning in the backward pass. Our key idea behind this\\nframework is that good representations are beneficial to image clustering and\\nclustering results provide supervisory signals to representation learning. By\\nintegrating two processes into a single model with a unified weighted triplet\\nloss and optimizing it end-to-end, we can obtain not only more powerful\\nrepresentations, but also more precise image clusters.

       "  'summary': u'  In a multi-class classification problem, it is standard to model the output\\nof a neural network as a categorical distribution conditioned on the inputs.\\nThe output must therefore be positive and sum to one, which is traditionally\\nenforced by a softmax. This probabilistic mapping allows to use the maximum\\nlikelihood principle, which leads to the well-known log-softmax loss. However\\nthe choice of the softmax function seems somehow arbitrary as there are many\\nother possible normalizing functions. It is thus unclear why the log-softmax\\nloss would perform better than other loss alternatives. In particular Vincent\\net al. (2015) recently introduced a class of loss functions, called the\\nspherical family, for which there exists an efficient algorithm to compute the\\nupdates of the output weights irrespective of the output size. In this paper,\\nwe explore several loss functions from this family as possible alternatives to\\nthe traditional log-softmax. In particular, we focus our investigation on\\nspherical bounds of the log-softmax loss and on two spherical log-likelihood\\nlosses, namely the log-Spherical Softmax suggested by Vincent et al. (2015) and\\nthe log-Taylor Softmax that we introduce. Although these alternatives do not\\nyield as good results as the log-softmax loss on two language modeling tasks,\\nthey surprisingly outperform it in our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10,\\nsuggesting that they might be relevant in a broad range of applications.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations\\nof Gaussian processes (GPs) and are formally equivalent to neural networks with\\nmultiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are nonparametric probabilistic\\nmodels and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to\\ngeneralise, and provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than\\nalternative deep models. This paper develops a new approximate Bayesian\\nlearning scheme that enables DGPs to be applied to a range of medium to large\\nscale regression problems for the first time. The new method uses an\\napproximate Expectation Propagation procedure and a novel and efficient\\nextension of the probabilistic backpropagation algorithm for learning. We\\nevaluate the new method for non-linear regression on eleven real-world\\ndatasets, showing that it always outperforms GP regression and is almost always\\nbetter than state-of-the-art deterministic and sampling-based approximate\\ninference methods for Bayesian neural networks. As a by-product, this work\\nprovides a comprehensive analysis of six approximate Bayesian methods for\\ntraining neural networks.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u\"  Technology and collaboration enable dramatic increases in the size of\\npsychological and psychiatric data collections, but finding structure in these\\nlarge data sets with many collected variables is challenging. Decision tree\\nensembles like random forests (Strobl, Malley, and Tutz, 2009) are a useful\\ntool for finding structure, but are difficult to interpret with multiple\\noutcome variables which are often of interest in psychology. To find and\\ninterpret structure in data sets with multiple outcomes and many predictors\\n(possibly exceeding the sample size), we introduce a multivariate extension to\\na decision tree ensemble method called Gradient Boosted Regression Trees\\n(Friedman, 2001). Our method, multivariate tree boosting, can be used for\\nidentifying important predictors, detecting predictors with non-linear effects\\nand interactions without specification of such effects, and for identifying\\npredictors that cause two or more outcome variables to covary without\\nparametric assumptions. We provide the R package 'mvtboost' to estimate, tune,\\nand interpret the resulting model, which extends the implementation of\\nunivariate boosting in the R package 'gbm' (Ridgeway, 2013) to continuous,\\nmultivariate outcomes. To illustrate the approach, we analyze predictors of\\npsychological well-being (Ryff and Keyes, 1995). Simulations verify that our\\napproach identifies predictors with non-linear effects and achieves high\\nprediction accuracy, exceeding or matching the performance of (penalized)\\nmultivariate multiple regression and multivariate decision trees over a wide\\nrange of conditions.\\n\",\n",

Unlike existing support detection methods that identify support\\nindices with the largest correlation value in magnitude per iteration, the\\nproposed method selects them with the largest likelihood ratios computed under\\nthe true and null support hypotheses by simultaneously exploiting the\\ndistributions of sensing matrix, sparse signal, and noise. Leveraging this\\ntechnique, MAP-Matching Pursuit (MAP-MP) is first presented to show the\\nadvantages of exploiting the proposed support detection method, and a\\nsufficient condition for perfect signal recovery is derived for the case when\\nthe sparse signal is binary.

       "  'summary': u'  Conditional belief networks introduce stochastic binary variables in neural\\nnetworks. Contrary to a classical neural network, a belief network can predict\\nmore than the expected value of the output $Y$ given the input $X$. It can\\npredict a distribution of outputs $Y$ which is useful when an input can admit\\nmultiple outputs whose average is not necessarily a valid answer. Such networks\\nare particularly relevant to inverse problems such as image prediction for\\ndenoising, or text to speech. However, traditional sigmoid belief networks are\\nhard to train and are not suited to continuous problems. This work introduces a\\nnew family of networks called linearizing belief nets or LBNs. A LBN decomposes\\ninto a deep linear network where each linear unit can be turned on or off by\\nnon-deterministic binary latent units. It is a universal approximator of\\nreal-valued conditional distributions and can be trained using gradient\\ndescent. Moreover, the linear pathways efficiently propagate continuous\\ninformation and they act as multiplicative skip-connections that help\\noptimization by removing gradient diffusion. This yields a model which trains\\nefficiently and improves the state-of-the-art on image denoising and facial\\nexpression generation with the Toronto faces dataset.\\n',\n",

In the progress of treatment planning, localization of the tumor\\nas the target volume and adjacent organs of risks by segmentation is crucial to\\naccomplish an optimal radiation distribution to the tumor while simultaneously\\npreserving healthy tissue. Segmentation is performed manually and represents a\\ntime-consuming task in clinical daily routine.

The scheme\\ncreates a directed two dimensional graph, followed by the minimal cost closed\\nset computation on the graph, resulting in an outlining of the rectum. The\\ngraphs outline is dynamically adapted to the last calculated cut.

       "  'summary': u'  Motivated by the success of powerful while expensive techniques to recognize\\nwords in a holistic way, object proposals techniques emerge as an alternative\\nto the traditional text detectors. In this paper we introduce a novel object\\nproposals method that is specifically designed for text. We rely on a\\nsimilarity based region grouping algorithm that generates a hierarchy of word\\nhypotheses. Over the nodes of this hierarchy it is possible to apply a holistic\\nword recognition method in an efficient way.\\n  Our experiments demonstrate that the presented method is superior in its\\nability of producing good quality word proposals when compared with\\nclass-independent algorithms. We show impressive recall rates with a few\\nthousand proposals in different standard benchmarks, including focused or\\nincidental text datasets, and multi-language scenarios. Moreover, the\\ncombination of our object proposals with existing whole-word recognizers shows\\ncompetitive performance in end-to-end word spotting, and, in some benchmarks,\\noutperforms previously published results. Concretely, in the challenging\\nICDAR2015 Incidental Text dataset, we overcome in more than 10 percent f-score\\nthe best-performing method in the last ICDAR Robust Reading Competition.

We also introduce combinations of different shapes of\\nKronecker product to increase modeling capacity. Experiments on SVHN, scene\\ntext recognition and ImageNet dataset demonstrate that we can achieve $3.3\\n\\\\times$ speedup or $3.6 \\\\times$ parameter reduction with less than 1\\\\% drop in\\naccuracy, showing the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Moreover, the\\ncomputation efficiency of Kronecker layer makes using larger feature map\\npossible, which in turn enables us to outperform the previous state-of-the-art\\non both SVHN(digit recognition) and CASIA-HWDB (handwritten Chinese character\\nrecognition) datasets.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Representation learning is the foundation for the recent success of neural\\nnetwork models. However, the distributed representations generated by neural\\nnetworks are far from ideal. Due to their highly entangled nature, they are di\\ncult to reuse and interpret, and they do a poor job of capturing the sparsity\\nwhich is present in real- world transformations. In this paper, I describe\\nmethods for learning disentangled representations in the two domains of\\ngraphics and computation. These methods allow neural methods to learn\\nrepresentations which are easy to interpret and reuse, yet they incur little or\\nno penalty to performance. In the Graphics section, I demonstrate the ability\\nof these methods to infer the generating parameters of images and rerender\\nthose images under novel conditions. In the Computation section, I describe a\\nmodel which is able to factorize a multitask learning problem into subtasks and\\nwhich experiences no catastrophic forgetting. Together these techniques provide\\nthe tools to design a wide range of models that learn disentangled\\nrepresentations and better model the factors of variation in the real world.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Popular Hough Transform-based object detection approaches usually construct\\nan appearance codebook by clustering local image features. However, how to\\nchoose appropriate values for the parameters used in the clustering step\\nremains an open problem. Moreover, some popular histogram features extracted\\nfrom overlapping image blocks may cause a high degree of redundancy and\\nmulticollinearity. In this paper, we propose a novel Hough Transform-based\\nobject detection approach. First, to address the above issues, we exploit a\\nBridge Partial Least Squares (BPLS) technique to establish context-encoded\\nHough Regression Models (HRMs), which are linear regression models that cast\\nprobabilistic Hough votes to predict object locations. BPLS is an efficient\\nvariant of Partial Least Squares (PLS). PLS-based regression techniques\\n(including BPLS) can reduce the redundancy and eliminate the multicollinearity\\nof a feature set. And the appropriate value of the only parameter used in PLS\\n(i.e., the number of latent components) can be determined by using a\\ncross-validation procedure. Second, to efficiently handle object scale changes,\\nwe propose a novel multi-scale voting scheme. In this scheme, multiple Hough\\nimages corresponding to multiple object scales can be obtained simultaneously.\\nThird, an object in a test image may correspond to multiple true and false\\npositive hypotheses at different scales. Based on the proposed multi-scale\\nvoting scheme, a principled strategy is proposed to fuse hypotheses to reduce\\nfalse positives by evaluating normalized pointwise mutual information between\\nhypotheses. In the experiments, we also compare the proposed HRM approach with\\nits several variants to evaluate the influences of its components on its\\nperformance. Experimental results show that the proposed HRM approach has\\nachieved desirable performances on popular benchmark datasets.\\n',\n",

On the other hand, word embedding has emerged as\\na newly favorite research subject because of its excellent performance in many\\nnatural language processing (NLP)-related tasks. However, as far as we are\\naware, there are relatively few studies investigating its use in extractive\\ntext or speech summarization. A common thread of leveraging word embeddings in\\nthe summarization process is to represent the document (or sentence) by\\naveraging the word embeddings of the words occurring in the document (or\\nsentence).

Beyond the\\ncontinued efforts made to improve the representation of words, this paper\\nfocuses on building novel and efficient ranking models based on the general\\nword embedding methods for extractive speech summarization.

       "  'summary': u'  Kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) is a nonlinear multi-view\\nrepresentation learning technique with broad applicability in statistics and\\nmachine learning. Although there is a closed-form solution for the KCCA\\nobjective, it involves solving an $N\\\\times N$ eigenvalue system where $N$ is\\nthe training set size, making its computational requirements in both memory and\\ntime prohibitive for large-scale problems. Various approximation techniques\\nhave been developed for KCCA. A commonly used approach is to first transform\\nthe original inputs to an $M$-dimensional random feature space so that inner\\nproducts in the feature space approximate kernel evaluations, and then apply\\nlinear CCA to the transformed inputs. In many applications, however, the\\ndimensionality $M$ of the random feature space may need to be very large in\\norder to obtain a sufficiently good approximation; it then becomes challenging\\nto perform the linear CCA step on the resulting very high-dimensional data\\nmatrices. We show how to use a stochastic optimization algorithm, recently\\nproposed for linear CCA and its neural-network extension, to further alleviate\\nthe computation requirements of approximate KCCA. This approach allows us to\\nrun approximate KCCA on a speech dataset with $1.4$ million training samples\\nand a random feature space of dimensionality $M=100000$ on a typical\\nworkstation.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Computer vision has a great potential to help our daily lives by searching\\nfor lost keys, watering flowers or reminding us to take a pill. To succeed with\\nsuch tasks, computer vision methods need to be trained from real and diverse\\nexamples of our daily dynamic scenes. While most of such scenes are not\\nparticularly exciting, they typically do not appear on YouTube, in movies or TV\\nbroadcasts. So how do we collect sufficiently many diverse but boring samples\\nrepresenting our lives? We propose a novel Hollywood in Homes approach to\\ncollect such data. Instead of shooting videos in the lab, we ensure diversity\\nby distributing and crowdsourcing the whole process of video creation from\\nscript writing to video recording and annotation. Following this procedure we\\ncollect a new dataset, Charades, with hundreds of people recording videos in\\ntheir own homes, acting out casual everyday activities. The dataset is composed\\nof 9,850 annotated videos with an average length of 30 seconds, showing\\nactivities of 267 people from three continents. Each video is annotated by\\nmultiple free-text descriptions, action labels, action intervals and classes of\\ninteracted objects. In total, Charades provides 27,847 video descriptions,\\n37,972 temporally localized intervals for 160 action classes and 24,623 labels\\nfor 40 object classes. Using this rich data, we evaluate and provide baseline\\nresults for several tasks including action recognition and automatic\\ndescription generation.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [3], [5] etc. has proved that\\ntongue, face and sublingual diagnosis as a noninvasive method is a reasonable\\nway for disease detection. However, most previous works only focus on a single\\nmodality (tongue, face or sublingual) for diagnosis, although different\\nmodalities may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of DM and\\nIGR. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal classification method to\\ndiscriminate between DM (or IGR) and healthy controls. Specially, the tongue,\\nfacial and sublingual images are first collected by using a non-invasive\\ncapture device. The color, texture and geometry features of these three types\\nof images are then extracted, respectively. Finally, our so-called multi-modal\\nsimilar and specific learning (MMSSL) approach is proposed to combine features\\nof tongue, face and sublingual, which not only exploits the correlation but\\nalso extracts individual components among them. Experimental results on a\\ndataset consisting of 192 Healthy, 198 DM and 114 IGR samples (all samples were\\nobtained from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine)\\nsubstantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method for the\\ndiagnosis of DM and IGR, compared to the case of using a single modality.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u\"  Recent research has shown great progress on fine-grained entity typing. Most\\nexisting methods require pre-defining a set of types and training a multi-class\\nclassifier from a large labeled data set based on multi-level linguistic\\nfeatures.

Current prevailing DL methods\\nusually adopt existing well-performing features, ignoring the inner\\nrelationship between dictionaries and features.

The new prior\\nis reminiscent to the conventional graph Laplacian but with stronger\\nreconstruction performance. It can also be shown that the overall\\nreconstruction has an efficient closed-form implementation if the associated\\nsymmetric smoothing filter is low rank. The results are validated with\\nexperiments on image inpainting.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We describe a seriation algorithm for ranking a set of items given pairwise\\ncomparisons between these items. Intuitively, the algorithm assigns similar\\nrankings to items that compare similarly with all others. It does so by\\nconstructing a similarity matrix from pairwise comparisons, using seriation\\nmethods to reorder this matrix and construct a ranking. We first show that this\\nspectral seriation algorithm recovers the true ranking when all pairwise\\ncomparisons are observed and consistent with a total order. We then show that\\nranking reconstruction is still exact when some pairwise comparisons are\\ncorrupted or missing, and that seriation based spectral ranking is more robust\\nto noise than classical scoring methods. Finally, we bound the ranking error\\nwhen only a random subset of the comparions are observed. An additional benefit\\nof the seriation formulation is that it allows us to solve semi-supervised\\nranking problems.

       "  'summary': u'  Feature descriptors, such as SIFT and ORB, are well-known for their\\nrobustness to illumination changes, which has made them popular for\\nfeature-based VSLAM\\\\@. However, in degraded imaging conditions such as low\\nlight, low texture, blur and specular reflections, feature extraction is often\\nunreliable. In contrast, direct VSLAM methods which estimate the camera pose by\\nminimizing the photometric error using raw pixel intensities are often more\\nrobust to low textured environments and blur. Nonetheless, at the core of\\ndirect VSLAM is the reliance on a consistent photometric appearance across\\nimages, otherwise known as the brightness constancy assumption. Unfortunately,\\nbrightness constancy seldom holds in real world applications.\\n  In this work, we overcome brightness constancy by incorporating feature\\ndescriptors into a direct visual odometry framework. This combination results\\nin an efficient algorithm that combines the strength of both feature-based\\nalgorithms and direct methods. Namely, we achieve robustness to arbitrary\\nphotometric variations while operating in low-textured and poorly lit\\nenvironments. Our approach utilizes an efficient binary descriptor, which we\\ncall Bit-Planes, and show how it can be used in the gradient-based optimization\\nrequired by direct methods. Moreover, we show that the squared Euclidean\\ndistance between Bit-Planes is equivalent to the Hamming distance.

Another popular approach to model the multimodal data is through deep\\nneural networks, such as the deep Boltzmann machine (DBM). Recently, a new type\\nof topic model called the Document Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator\\n(DocNADE) was proposed and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for text\\ndocument modeling. In this work, we show how to successfully apply and extend\\nthis model to multimodal data, such as simultaneous image classification and\\nannotation. First, we propose SupDocNADE, a supervised extension of DocNADE,\\nthat increases the discriminative power of the learned hidden topic features\\nand show how to employ it to learn a joint representation from image visual\\nwords, annotation words and class label information. We test our model on the\\nLabelMe and UIUC-Sports data sets and show that it compares favorably to other\\ntopic models. Second, we propose a deep extension of our model and provide an\\nefficient way of training the deep model.

More\\nspecifically, we observe that given a set of object proposals extracted from an\\nimage that contains the object of interest, an accurate strongly supervised\\nobject detector should give high scores to only a small minority of proposals,\\nand low scores to most of them. Thus, we devise an entropy-based objective\\nfunction to enforce the above property when learning the common object\\ndetector. Once the detector is learnt, we resort to a segmentation approach to\\nrefine the localization. We show that despite its simplicity, our approach\\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u\"  In recent years, consumer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have become very popular,\\neveryone can buy and fly a drone without previous experience, which raises\\nconcern in regards to regulations and public safety. In this paper, we present\\na novel approach towards enabling safe operation of such vehicles in urban\\nareas. Our method uses geodetically accurate dataset images with Geographical\\nInformation System (GIS) data of road networks and buildings provided by Google\\nMaps, to compute a weighted A* shortest path from start to end locations of a\\nmission. Weights represent the potential risk of injuries for individuals in\\nall categories of land-use, i.e. flying over buildings is considered safer than\\nabove roads. We enable safe UAV operation in regards to 1- land-use by\\ncomputing a static global path dependent on environmental structures, and 2-\\navoiding flying over moving objects such as cars and pedestrians by dynamically\\noptimizing the path locally during the flight. As all input sources are first\\ngeo-registered, pixels and GPS coordinates are equivalent, it therefore allows\\nus to generate an automated and user-friendly mission with GPS waypoints\\nreadable by consumer drones' autopilots. We simulated 54 missions and show\\nsignificant improvement in maximizing UAV's standoff distance to moving objects\\nwith a quantified safety parameter over 40 times better than the naive straight\\nline navigation.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Action recognition in still images has seen major improvement in recent years\\ndue to advances in human pose estimation, object recognition and stronger\\nfeature representations produced by deep neural networks. However, there are\\nstill many cases in which performance remains far from that of humans. A major\\ndifficulty arises in distinguishing between transitive actions in which the\\noverall actor pose is similar, and recognition therefore depends on details of\\nthe grasp and the object, which may be largely occluded. In this paper we\\ndemonstrate how recognition is improved by obtaining precise localization of\\nthe action-object and consequently extracting details of the object shape\\ntogether with the actor-object interaction. To obtain exact localization of the\\naction object and its interaction with the actor, we employ a coarse-to-fine\\napproach which combines semantic segmentation and contextual features, in\\nsuccessive stages. We focus on (but are not limited) to face-related actions, a\\nset of actions that includes several currently challenging categories. We\\npresent an average relative improvement of 35% over state-of-the art and\\nvalidate through experimentation the effectiveness of our approach.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  One-class classifiers offer valuable tools to assess the presence of outliers\\nin data. In this paper, we propose a design methodology for one-class\\nclassifiers based on entropic spanning graphs. The spanning graph is learned on\\nthe embedded input data, with the aim to generate a partition of the vertices.\\nThe final partition is derived by exploiting a criterion based on mutual\\ninformation minimization. Here, we compute the mutual information by using a\\nconvenient formulation provided in terms of the $\\\\alpha$-Jensen difference.\\nOnce training is completed, in order to associate a confidence level with the\\nclassifier decision, a graph-based fuzzy model is constructed. The\\nfuzzification process is based only on topological information of the vertices\\nof the entropic spanning graph. As such, the proposed one-class classifier is\\nsuitable also for datasets with complex geometric structures. We provide\\nexperiments on well-known benchmarking datasets containing both feature vectors\\nand labeled graphs. In addition, we apply the method on the problem of protein\\nsolubility recognition by considering several data representations for the\\nsamples. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of\\nthe proposed method with respect to other state-of-the-art approaches.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  In this paper, we introduce a new deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet)\\nmodule that promotes competition among a set of multi-scale convolutional\\nfilters. This new module is inspired by the inception module, where we replace\\nthe original collaborative pooling stage (consisting of a concatenation of the\\nmulti-scale filter outputs) by a competitive pooling represented by a maxout\\nactivation unit. This extension has the following two objectives: 1) the\\nselection of the maximum response among the multi-scale filters prevents filter\\nco-adaptation and allows the formation of multiple sub-networks within the same\\nmodel, which has been shown to facilitate the training of complex learning\\nproblems; and 2) the maxout unit reduces the dimensionality of the outputs from\\nthe multi-scale filters. We show that the use of our proposed module in typical\\ndeep ConvNets produces classification results that are either better than or\\ncomparable to the state of the art on the following benchmark datasets: MNIST,\\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Reinforcement learning has significant applications for multi-agent systems,\\nespecially in unknown dynamic environments. However, most multi-agent\\nreinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as\\nexponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes\\nit difficult to scale up to realistic multi-agent problems. In this paper, a\\nnovel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI)\\nis presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction based MARL\\nalgorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for\\nagents to select the non-strict Equilibrium Dominating Strategy Profile\\n(non-strict EDSP) or Meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented\\nNegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for\\nsparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum\\nvariance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of\\nlocal Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared\\nvalue functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to\\nachieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational\\ncomplexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI\\nalgorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria:\\nsteps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime\\n(AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games\\nand shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm.\\nThen in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent\\nwarehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\\npresented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL\\nalgorithms.\\n',\n",

Since\\nlittle is known about profiles that have a certain Condorcet dimension, we show\\nin this paper how the problem of finding a preference profile that has a given\\nCondorcet dimension can be encoded as a satisfiability problem and solved by a\\nSAT solver. Initial results include a minimal example of a preference profile\\nof Condorcet dimension 3, improving previously known examples both in terms of\\nthe number of agents as well as alternatives. Due to the high complexity of\\nsuch problems it remains open whether a preference profile of Condorcet\\ndimension 4 exists.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  In many scientific and engineering applications, we are tasked with the\\noptimisation of an expensive to evaluate black box function $f$. Traditional\\nmethods for this problem assume just the availability of this single function.\\nHowever, in many cases, cheap approximations to $f$ may be obtainable. For\\nexample, the expensive real world behaviour of a robot can be approximated by a\\ncheap computer simulation. We can use these approximations to eliminate low\\nfunction value regions and use the expensive evaluations to $f$ in a small\\npromising region and speedily identify the optimum. We formalise this task as a\\n\\\\emph{multi-fidelity} bandit problem where the target function and its\\napproximations are sampled from a Gaussian process. We develop a method based\\non upper confidence bound techniques and prove that it exhibits precisely the\\nabove behaviour, hence achieving better regret than strategies which ignore\\nmulti-fidelity information.

We train and test several generative and retrieval\\nmodels to tackle the task of VQG. Evaluation results show that while such\\nmodels ask reasonable questions for a variety of images, there is still a wide\\ngap with human performance which motivates further work on connecting images\\nwith commonsense knowledge and pragmatics.

       "  'summary': u'  The complex compositional structure of language makes problems at the\\nintersection of vision and language challenging. But language also provides a\\nstrong prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the\\nunderlying models truly understanding the visual content.

We formulate this problem as visual verification of concepts\\ninquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert the question to a tuple\\nthat concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected in the image. If\\nthe concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question is \"yes\", and\\notherwise \"no\". Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to focus on\\nthe high-level semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level\\nrecognition problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the\\nmodality to balance the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and\\nthe role of vision is essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs\\nof scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is \"yes\" for\\none scene, and \"no\" for the other for the exact same question. Indeed, language\\npriors alone do not perform better than chance on our balanced dataset.\\nMoreover, our proposed approach matches the performance of a state-of-the-art\\nVQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms it on the balanced\\ndataset.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Real-time, accurate, and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite\\nfor pervasive video-based eye-tracking. However, automated pupil detection in\\nreal-world scenarios has proven to be an intricate challenge due to fast\\nillumination changes, pupil occlusion, non centered and off-axis eye recording,\\nand physiological eye characteristics. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a\\nmethod based on a novel dual convolutional neural network pipeline. In its\\nfirst stage the pipeline performs coarse pupil position identification using a\\nconvolutional neural network and subregions from a downscaled input image to\\ndecrease computational costs. Using subregions derived from a small window\\naround the initial pupil position estimate, the second pipeline stage employs\\nanother convolutional neural network to refine this position, resulting in an\\nincreased pupil detection rate up to 25% in comparison with the best performing\\nstate-of-the-art algorithm.

The\\nfeatures useful for object classification are learned by feed-forward deep\\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically, and they are shown to be\\nable to predict and decode neural representations in the ventral visual pathway\\nof humans and monkeys.

       "  'summary': u'  Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown their great\\nsuccess on image classification. CNNs mainly consist of convolutional and\\npooling layers, both of which are performed on local image areas without\\nconsidering the dependencies among different image regions. However, such\\ndependencies are very important for generating explicit image representation.\\nIn contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well known for their ability\\nof encoding contextual information among sequential data, and they only require\\na limited number of network parameters. General RNNs can hardly be directly\\napplied on non-sequential data. Thus, we proposed the hierarchical RNNs\\n(HRNNs). In HRNNs, each RNN layer focuses on modeling spatial dependencies\\namong image regions from the same scale but different locations. While the\\ncross RNN scale connections target on modeling scale dependencies among regions\\nfrom the same location but different scales. Specifically, we propose two\\nrecurrent neural network models: 1) hierarchical simple recurrent network\\n(HSRN), which is fast and has low computational cost; and 2) hierarchical\\nlong-short term memory recurrent network (HLSTM), which performs better than\\nHSRN with the price of more computational cost.\\n  In this manuscript, we integrate CNNs with HRNNs, and develop end-to-end\\nconvolutional hierarchical recurrent neural networks (C-HRNNs). C-HRNNs not\\nonly make use of the representation power of CNNs, but also efficiently encodes\\nspatial and scale dependencies among different image regions. On four of the\\nmost challenging object/scene image classification benchmarks, our C-HRNNs\\nachieve state-of-the-art results on Places 205, SUN 397, MIT indoor, and\\ncompetitive results on ILSVRC 2012.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  In practice, there are often explicit constraints on what representations or\\ndecisions are acceptable in an application of machine learning. For example it\\nmay be a legal requirement that a decision must not favour a particular group.\\nAlternatively it can be that that representation of data must not have\\nidentifying information. We address these two related issues by learning\\nflexible representations that minimize the capability of an adversarial critic.\\nThis adversary is trying to predict the relevant sensitive variable from the\\nrepresentation, and so minimizing the performance of the adversary ensures\\nthere is little or no information in the representation about the sensitive\\nvariable. We demonstrate this adversarial approach on two problems: making\\ndecisions free from discrimination and removing private information from\\nimages. We formulate the adversarial model as a minimax problem, and optimize\\nthat minimax objective using a stochastic gradient alternate min-max optimizer.\\nWe demonstrate the ability to provide discriminant free representations for\\nstandard test problems, and compare with previous state of the art methods for\\nfairness, showing statistically significant improvement across most cases. The\\nflexibility of this method is shown via a novel problem: removing annotations\\nfrom images, from unaligned training examples of annotated and unannotated\\nimages, and with no a priori knowledge of the form of annotation provided to\\nthe model.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We consider the link prediction problem in a partially observed network,\\nwhere the objective is to make predictions in the unobserved portion of the\\nnetwork. Many existing methods reduce link prediction to binary classification\\nproblem.

In this paper, we present a real-time 3D shape search\\nengine based on the projective images of 3D shapes.

As a result, for each query the retrieval task can be\\nfinished within one second despite the necessary cost of IO overhead.

       "  'summary': u'  Studying the function of proteins is important for understanding the\\nmolecular mechanisms of life. The number of publicly available protein\\nstructures has increasingly become extremely large. Still, the determination of\\nthe function of a protein structure remains a difficult, costly, and time\\nconsuming task. The difficulties are often due to the essential role of spatial\\nand topological structures in the determination of protein functions in living\\ncells. In this paper, we propose ProtNN, a novel approach for protein function\\nprediction. Given an unannotated protein structure and a set of annotated\\nproteins, ProtNN finds the nearest neighbor annotated structures based on\\nprotein-graph pairwise similarities. Given a query protein, ProtNN finds the\\nnearest neighbor reference proteins based on a graph representation model and a\\npairwise similarity between vector embedding of both query and reference\\nprotein-graphs in structural and topological spaces. ProtNN assigns to the\\nquery protein the function with the highest number of votes across the set of k\\nnearest neighbor reference proteins, where k is a user-defined parameter.\\nExperimental evaluation demonstrates that ProtNN is able to accurately classify\\nseveral datasets in an extremely fast runtime compared to state-of-the-art\\napproaches. We further show that ProtNN is able to scale up to a whole PDB\\ndataset in a single-process mode with no parallelization, with a gain of\\nthousands order of magnitude of runtime compared to state-of-the-art\\napproaches.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach to learn visual features\\nonline for improving loop-closure detection and place recognition, based on\\nbag-of-words frameworks. The approach learns a codeword in bag-of-words model\\nfrom a pair of matched features from two consecutive frames, such that the\\ncodeword has temporally-derived perspective invariance to camera motion. The\\nlearning algorithm is efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the\\nmean image patch, and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by\\nminimizing the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two\\noriginal features. A codeword for bag-of-words models is generated by packaging\\nthe learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to\\nmeasure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the\\nlearned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis\\nconstraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords,\\nwhich improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental\\nbag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared\\nto state-of-the-art methods.

       "  'summary': u'  Submodular set-functions have many applications in combinatorial\\noptimization, as they can be minimized and approximately maximized in\\npolynomial time. A key element in many of the algorithms and analyses is the\\npossibility of extending the submodular set-function to a convex function,\\nwhich opens up tools from convex optimization. Submodularity goes beyond\\nset-functions and has naturally been considered for problems with multiple\\nlabels or for functions defined on continuous domains, where it corresponds\\nessentially to cross second-derivatives being nonpositive. In this paper, we\\nshow that most results relating submodularity and convexity for set-functions\\ncan be extended to all submodular functions. In particular, (a) we naturally\\ndefine a continuous extension in a set of probability measures, (b) show that\\nthe extension is convex if and only if the original function is submodular, (c)\\nprove that the problem of minimizing a submodular function is equivalent to a\\ntypically non-smooth convex optimization problem, and (d) propose another\\nconvex optimization problem with better computational properties (e.g., a\\nsmooth dual problem). Most of these extensions from the set-function situation\\nare obtained by drawing links with the theory of multi-marginal optimal\\ntransport, which provides also a new interpretation of existing results for\\nset-functions. We then provide practical algorithms to minimize generic\\nsubmodular functions on discrete domains, with associated convergence rates.\\n',\n",

Instead of using a linear filter for convolution,\\nNiN utilizes shallow MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), a nonlinear function, to\\nreplace the linear filter. Because of the powerfulness of MLP and $ 1\\\\times 1 $\\nconvolutions in spatial domain, NiN has stronger ability of feature\\nrepresentation and hence results in better recognition rate. However, MLP\\nitself consists of fully connected layers which give rise to a large number of\\nparameters. In this paper, we propose to replace dense shallow MLP with sparse\\nshallow MLP. One or more layers of the sparse shallow MLP are sparely connected\\nin the channel dimension or channel-spatial domain. The proposed method is\\nimplemented by applying unshared convolution across the channel dimension and\\napplying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational\\nlayers.

       "  'summary': u\"  Deep convolutional neural networks have led to breakthrough results in\\npractical feature extraction applications. The mathematical analysis of such\\nnetworks was initiated by Mallat, 2012. Specifically, Mallat considered\\nso-called scattering networks based on semi-discrete shift-invariant wavelet\\nframes and modulus non-linearities in each network layer, and proved\\ntranslation invariance (asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter) and\\ndeformation stability of the corresponding feature extractor. The purpose of\\nthis paper is to develop Mallat's theory further by allowing for general\\nconvolution kernels, or in more technical parlance, general semi-discrete\\nshift-invariant frames (including Weyl-Heisenberg, curvelet, shearlet,\\nridgelet, and wavelet frames) and general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities\\n(e.g., rectified linear units, shifted logistic sigmoids, hyperbolic tangents,\\nand modulus functions), as well as pooling through sub-sampling, all of which\\ncan be different in different network layers. The resulting generalized network\\nenables extraction of significantly wider classes of features than those\\nresolved by Mallat's wavelet-modulus scattering network. We prove deformation\\nstability for a larger class of deformations than those considered by Mallat,\\nand we establish a new translation invariance result which is of vertical\\nnature in the sense of the network depth determining the amount of invariance.\\nMoreover, our results establish that deformation stability and vertical\\ntranslation invariance are guaranteed by the network structure per se rather\\nthan the specific convolution kernels and non-linearities. This offers an\\nexplanation for the tremendous success of deep convolutional neural networks in\\na wide variety of practical feature extraction applications.

       "  'summary': u'  The conjugate gradient (CG) method is an efficient iterative method for\\nsolving large-scale strongly convex quadratic programming (QP). In this paper\\nwe propose some generalized CG (GCG) methods for solving the\\n$\\\\ell_1$-regularized (possibly not strongly) convex QP that terminate at an\\noptimal solution in a finite number of iterations. At each iteration, our\\nmethods first identify a face of an orthant and then either perform an exact\\nline search along the direction of the negative projected minimum-norm\\nsubgradient of the objective function or execute a CG subroutine that conducts\\na sequence of CG iterations until a CG iterate crosses the boundary of this\\nface or an approximate minimizer of over this face or a subface is found. We\\ndetermine which type of step should be taken by comparing the magnitude of some\\ncomponents of the minimum-norm subgradient of the objective function to that of\\nits rest components. Our analysis on finite convergence of these methods makes\\nuse of an error bound result and some key properties of the aforementioned\\nexact line search and the CG subroutine. We also show that the proposed methods\\nare capable of finding an approximate solution of the problem by allowing some\\ninexactness on the execution of the CG subroutine. The overall arithmetic\\noperation cost of our GCG methods for finding an $\\\\epsilon$-optimal solution\\ndepends on $\\\\epsilon$ in $O(\\\\log(1/\\\\epsilon))$, which is superior to the\\naccelerated proximal gradient method [2,23] that depends on $\\\\epsilon$ in\\n$O(1/\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon})$.

       "  'summary': u'  Hashing methods aim to learn a set of hash functions which map the original\\nfeatures to compact binary codes with similarity preserving in the Hamming\\nspace. Hashing has proven a valuable tool for large-scale information\\nretrieval. We propose a column generation based binary code learning framework\\nfor data-dependent hash function learning. Given a set of triplets that encode\\nthe pairwise similarity comparison information, our column generation based\\nmethod learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relations\\nwithin the large-margin learning framework. Our method iteratively learns the\\nbest hash functions during the column generation procedure. Existing hashing\\nmethods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or\\ngraph Laplacian related loss functions, instead of the performance evaluation\\ncriteria of interest---multivariate performance measures such as the AUC and\\nNDCG. Our column generation based method can be further generalized from the\\ntriplet loss to a general structured learning based framework that allows one\\nto directly optimize multivariate performance measures. For optimizing general\\nranking measures, the resulting optimization problem can involve exponentially\\nor infinitely many variables and constraints, which is more challenging than\\nstandard structured output learning. We use a combination of column generation\\nand cutting-plane techniques to solve the optimization problem. To speed-up the\\ntraining we further explore stage-wise training and propose to use a simplified\\nNDCG loss for efficient inference.

       "  'summary': u\"  In this paper, we study shortlists as an interface component for recommender\\nsystems with the dual goal of supporting the user's decision process, as well\\nas improving implicit feedback elicitation for increased recommendation\\nquality. A shortlist is a temporary list of candidates that the user is\\ncurrently considering, e.g., a list of a few movies the user is currently\\nconsidering for viewing. From a cognitive perspective, shortlists serve as\\ndigital short-term memory where users can off-load the items under\\nconsideration -- thereby decreasing their cognitive load. From a machine\\nlearning perspective, adding items to the shortlist generates a new implicit\\nfeedback signal as a by-product of exploration and decision making which can\\nimprove recommendation quality. Shortlisting therefore provides additional data\\nfor training recommendation systems without the increases in cognitive load\\nthat requesting explicit feedback would incur.\\n  We perform an user study with a movie recommendation setup to compare\\ninterfaces that offer shortlist support with those that do not. From the user\\nstudies we conclude: (i) users make better decisions with a shortlist; (ii)\\nusers prefer an interface with shortlist support; and (iii) the additional\\nimplicit feedback from sessions with a shortlist improves the quality of\\nrecommendations by nearly a factor of two.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Speech based solutions have taken center stage with growth in the services\\nindustry where there is a need to cater to a very large number of people from\\nall strata of the society. While natural language speech interfaces are the\\ntalk in the research community, yet in practice, menu based speech solutions\\nthrive. Typically in a menu based speech solution the user is required to\\nrespond by speaking from a closed set of words when prompted by the system. A\\nsequence of human speech response to the IVR prompts results in the completion\\nof a transaction. A transaction is deemed successful if the speech solution can\\ncorrectly recognize all the spoken utterances of the user whenever prompted by\\nthe system. The usual mechanism to evaluate the performance of a speech\\nsolution is to do an extensive test of the system by putting it to actual\\npeople use and then evaluating the performance by analyzing the logs for\\nsuccessful transactions. This kind of evaluation could lead to dissatisfied\\ntest users especially if the performance of the system were to result in a poor\\ntransaction completion rate. To negate this the Wizard of Oz approach is\\nadopted during evaluation of a speech system. Overall this kind of evaluations\\nis an expensive proposition both in terms of time and cost. In this paper, we\\npropose a method to evaluate the performance of a speech solution without\\nactually putting it to people use. We first describe the methodology and then\\nshow experimentally that this can be used to identify the performance\\nbottlenecks of the speech solution even before the system is actually used thus\\nsaving evaluation time and expenses.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  SGD is the widely adopted method to train CNN.

In this paper, we\\ndemonstrate Sampling Bias, Intrinsic Image Difference and Fixed Cycle Pseudo\\nRandom Sampling differentiate batches in training, which then affect learning\\nspeeds on them. Because of this, the unbiased treatment of batches involved in\\nSGD creates improper load balancing. To address this issue, we present\\nInconsistent Stochastic Gradient Descent (ISGD) to dynamically vary training\\neffort according to learning statuses on batches. Specifically ISGD leverages\\ntechniques in Statistical Process Control to identify a undertrained batch.\\nOnce a batch is undertrained, ISGD solves a new subproblem, a chasing logic\\nplus a conservative constraint, to accelerate the training on the batch while\\navoid drastic parameter changes. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets\\ndemonstrate ISGD converges faster than SGD.

       "  'summary': u'  Monte Carlo methods represent the \"de facto\" standard for approximating\\ncomplicated integrals involving multidimensional target distributions. In order\\nto generate random realizations from the target distribution, Monte Carlo\\ntechniques use simpler proposal probability densities to draw candidate\\nsamples.

In this work, we introduce a\\nlayered (i.e., hierarchical) procedure to generate samples employed within a\\nMonte Carlo scheme.

Finally, given these schemes, we also propose a novel class of\\nadaptive importance samplers using a population of proposals, where the\\nadaptation is driven by independent parallel or interacting Markov Chain Monte\\nCarlo (MCMC) chains.

       "  'summary': u'  The monolithic approach to policy representation in Markov Decision Processes\\n(MDPs) looks for a single policy that can be represented as a function from\\nstates to actions. For the monolithic approach to succeed (and this is not\\nalways possible), a complex feature representation is often necessary since the\\npolicy is a complex object that has to prescribe what actions to take all over\\nthe state space. This is especially true in large domains with complicated\\ndynamics. It is also computationally inefficient to both learn and plan in MDPs\\nusing a complex monolithic approach. We present a different approach where we\\nrestrict the policy space to policies that can be represented as combinations\\nof simpler, parameterized skills---a type of temporally extended action, with a\\nsimple policy representation. We introduce Learning Skills via Bootstrapping\\n(LSB) that can use a broad family of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms as\\na \"black box\" to iteratively learn parametrized skills. Initially, the learned\\nskills are short-sighted but each iteration of the algorithm allows the skills\\nto bootstrap off one another, improving each skill in the process. We prove\\nthat this bootstrapping process returns a near-optimal policy.

       "  'summary': u'  Two-Dimensional (2D) Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a basic and\\ncomputationally intensive algorithm, with a vast variety of applications. 2D\\nimages are, in general, non-periodic, but are assumed to be periodic while\\ncalculating their DFTs. This leads to cross-shaped artifacts in the frequency\\ndomain due to spectral leakage. These artifacts can have critical consequences\\nif the DFTs are being used for further processing. In this paper we present a\\nnovel FPGA-based design to calculate high-throughput 2D DFTs with simultaneous\\nedge artifact removal. Standard approaches for removing these artifacts using\\napodization functions or mirroring, either involve removing critical\\nfrequencies or a surge in computation by increasing image size. We use a\\nperiodic-plus-smooth decomposition based artifact removal algorithm optimized\\nfor FPGA implementation, while still achieving real-time ($\\\\ge$23 frames per\\nsecond) performance for a 512$\\\\times$512 size image stream. Our optimization\\napproach leads to a significant decrease in external memory utilization thereby\\navoiding memory conflicts and simplifies the design. We have tested our design\\non a PXIe based Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGA system communicating with a host PC which\\ngives us the advantage to further expand the design for industrial\\napplications.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We introduce a new top-down pipeline for scene text detection. We propose a\\nnovel Cascaded Convolutional Text Network (CCTN) that joints two customized\\nconvolutional networks for coarse-to-fine text localization. The CCTN fast\\ndetects text regions roughly from a low-resolution image, and then accurately\\nlocalizes text lines from each enlarged region. We cast previous character\\nbased detection into direct text region estimation, avoiding multiple bottom-\\nup post-processing steps. It exhibits surprising robustness and discriminative\\npower by considering whole text region as detection object which provides\\nstrong semantic information. We customize convolutional network by develop- ing\\nrectangle convolutions and multiple in-network fusions. This enables it to\\nhandle multi-shape and multi-scale text efficiently. Furthermore, the CCTN is\\ncomputationally efficient by sharing convolutional computations, and high-level\\nproperty allows it to be invariant to various languages and multiple\\norientations.

       "  'summary': u'  Base-detail separation is a fundamental computer vision problem consisting of\\nmodeling a smooth base layer with the coarse structures, and a detail layer\\ncontaining the texture-like structures. One of the challenges of estimating the\\nbase is to preserve sharp boundaries between objects or parts to avoid halo\\nartifacts. Many methods have been proposed to address this problem, but there\\nis no ground-truth dataset of real images for quantitative evaluation. We\\nproposed a procedure to construct such a dataset, and provide two datasets:\\nPascal Base-Detail and Fashionista Base-Detail, containing 1000 and 250 images,\\nrespectively. Our assumption is that the base is piecewise smooth and we label\\nthe appearance of each piece by a polynomial model. The pieces are objects and\\nparts of objects, obtained from human annotations.

       "  'summary': u'  Mixture modeling is a general technique for making any simple model more\\nexpressive through weighted combination. This generality and simplicity in part\\nexplains the success of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which\\nupdates are easy to derive for a wide class of mixture models. However, the\\nlikelihood of a mixture model is non-convex, so EM has no known global\\nconvergence guarantees. Recently, method of moments approaches offer global\\nguarantees for some mixture models, but they do not extend easily to the range\\nof mixture models that exist. In this work, we present Polymom, an unifying\\nframework based on method of moments in which estimation procedures are easily\\nderivable, just as in EM. Polymom is applicable when the moments of a single\\nmixture component are polynomials of the parameters. Our key observation is\\nthat the moments of the mixture model are a mixture of these polynomials, which\\nallows us to cast estimation as a Generalized Moment Problem. We solve its\\nrelaxations using semidefinite optimization, and then extract parameters using\\nideas from computer algebra. This framework allows us to draw insights and\\napply tools from convex optimization, computer algebra and the theory of\\nmoments to study problems in statistical estimation.\\n',\n",

However, scalability brings challenges of\\ndrift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated\\nmodel. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct\\nmodel errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results, but suffer\\nfrom: (1) needing minutes to perform online correction preventing true\\nreal-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation\\nresulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured\\npoint-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability.

At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy,\\noptimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the\\ncomplete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach.

       "  'summary': u'  Semi-supervised learning algorithms are an indispensable tool when labeled\\nexamples are scarce and there are many unlabeled examples [Blum and Chawla\\n2001, Zhu et. al. 2003]. With graph-based methods, entities (examples)\\ncorrespond to nodes in a graph and edges correspond to related entities. The\\ngraph structure is used to infer implicit pairwise affinity values (kernel)\\nwhich are used to compute the learned labels.\\n  Two powerful techniques to define such a kernel are \"symmetric\" spectral\\nmethods and Personalized Page Rank (PPR). With spectral methods, labels can be\\nscalably learned using Jacobi iterations, but an inherent limiting issue is\\nthat they are applicable to {\\\\em symmetric} (undirected) graphs, whereas often,\\nsuch as with like, follow, or hyperlinks, relations between entities are\\ninherently asymmetric. PPR naturally works with directed graphs but even with\\nstate of the art techniques does not scale when we want to learn billions of\\nlabels.\\n  Aiming at both high scalability and handling of directed relations, we\\npropose here {\\\\em Reach Diffusion} and {\\\\em Distance Diffusion} kernels. Our\\ndesign is inspired by models for influence diffusion in social networks,\\nformalized and spawned from the seminal work of [Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos\\n2003]. We tailor these models to define a natural asymmetric \"kernel\" and\\ndesign highly scalable algorithms for parameter setting and label learning.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Depth from defocus and defocus deblurring from a single image are two\\nchallenging problems that are derived from the finite depth of field in\\nconventional cameras. Coded aperture imaging is one of the techniques that is\\nused for improving the results of these two problems. Up to now, different\\nmethods have been proposed for improving the results of either defocus\\ndeblurring or depth estimation. In this paper, a multi-objective function is\\nproposed for evaluating and designing aperture patterns with the aim of\\nimproving the results of both depth from defocus and defocus deblurring.\\nPattern evaluation is performed by considering the scene illumination condition\\nand camera system specification. Based on the proposed criteria, a single\\nasymmetric pattern is designed that is used for restoring a sharp image and a\\ndepth map from a single input. Since the designed pattern is asymmetric,\\ndefocus objects on the two sides of the focal plane can be distinguished. Depth\\nestimation is performed by using a new algorithm, which is based on image\\nquality assessment criteria and can distinguish between blurred objects lying\\nin front or behind the focal plane.

       "  'summary': u'  Interactive object selection is a very important research problem and has\\nmany applications. Previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to\\nestimate the foreground and background distributions. In this paper, we present\\na novel deep learning based algorithm which has a much better understanding of\\nobjectness and thus can reduce user interactions to just a few clicks. Our\\nalgorithm transforms user provided positive and negative clicks into two\\nEuclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the RGB channels of\\nimages to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. We generate many of such\\npairs by combining several random sampling strategies to model user click\\npatterns and use them to fine tune deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs).\\nFinally the output probability maps of our FCN 8s model is integrated with\\ngraph cut optimization to refine the boundary segments.

Unfortunately, pixelwise\\nannotation of images at very large scale is labor-intensive and only little\\nlabeled data is available, particularly at instance level and for street\\nscenes. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem by lifting the\\nsemantic instance labeling task from 2D into 3D. Given reconstructions from\\nstereo or laser data, we annotate static 3D scene elements with rough bounding\\nprimitives and develop a model which transfers this information into the image\\ndomain. We leverage our method to obtain 2D labels for a novel suburban video\\ndataset which we have collected, resulting in 400k semantic and instance image\\nannotations. A comparison of our method to state-of-the-art label transfer\\nbaselines reveals that 3D information enables more efficient annotation while\\nat the same time resulting in improved accuracy and time-coherent labels.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Plausibility models are Kripke models that agents use to reason about\\nknowledge and belief, both of themselves and of each other.

The logic of conditional belief contains that modality and also\\nthe knowledge modality, and similarly for the logic of degrees of belief and\\nthe logic of safe belief. With respect to these logics, plausibility models may\\ncontain too much information. A proper notion of bisimulation is required that\\ncharacterises them.

       "  'summary': u'  In a wearable camera video, we see what the camera wearer sees. While this\\nmakes it easy to know roughly what he chose to look at, it does not immediately\\nreveal when he was engaged with the environment. Specifically, at what moments\\ndid his focus linger, as he paused to gather more information about something\\nhe saw? Knowing this answer would benefit various applications in video\\nsummarization and augmented reality, yet prior work focuses solely on the\\n\"what\" question (estimating saliency, gaze) without considering the \"when\"\\n(engagement). We propose a learning-based approach that uses long-term\\negomotion cues to detect engagement, specifically in browsing scenarios where\\none frequently takes in new visual information (e.g., shopping, touring). We\\nintroduce a large, richly annotated dataset for ego-engagement that is the\\nfirst of its kind.

       "  'summary': u'  In Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem for sequence data, the learning\\ndata consist of a set of bags where each bag contains a set of\\ninstances/sequences. In many real world applications such as bioinformatics,\\nweb mining, and text mining, comparing a random couple of sequences makes no\\nsense. In fact, each instance of each bag may have structural and/or temporal\\nrelation with other instances in other bags. Thus, the classification task\\nshould take into account the relation between semantically related instances\\nacross bags. In this paper, we present two novel MIL approaches for sequence\\ndata classification: (1) ABClass and (2) ABSim. In ABClass, each sequence is\\nrepresented by one vector of attributes. For each sequence of the unknown bag,\\na discriminative classifier is applied in order to compute a partial\\nclassification result. Then, an aggregation method is applied to these partial\\nresults in order to generate the final result. In ABSim, we use a similarity\\nmeasure between each sequence of the unknown bag and the corresponding\\nsequences in the learning bags. An unknown bag is labeled with the bag that\\npresents more similar sequences. We applied both approaches to the problem of\\nbacterial Ionizing Radiation Resistance (IRR) prediction. We evaluated and\\ndiscussed the proposed approaches on well known Ionizing Radiation Resistance\\nBacteria (IRRB) and Ionizing Radiation Sensitive Bacteria (IRSB) represented by\\nprimary structure of basal DNA repair proteins. The experimental results show\\nthat both ABClass and ABSim approaches are efficient.\\n',\n",

Proposed methods for the operating room (OR) rely\\neither on foreground estimation using a multi-camera system, which is a\\nchallenge in real ORs due to color similarities and frequent illumination\\nchanges, or on wearable sensors or markers, which are invasive and therefore\\ndifficult to introduce in the room. Instead, we propose a novel approach based\\non Pictorial Structures (PS) and on RGB-D data, which can be easily deployed in\\nreal ORs. We extend the PS framework in two ways. First, we build robust and\\ndiscriminative part detectors using both color and depth images. We also\\npresent a novel descriptor for depth images, called histogram of depth\\ndifferences (HDD). Second, we extend PS to 3D by proposing 3D pairwise\\nconstraints and a new method for exact and tractable inference. Our approach is\\nevaluated for pose estimation and clinician detection on a challenging RGB-D\\ndataset recorded in a busy operating room during live surgeries. We conduct\\nseries of experiments to study the different part detectors in conjunction with\\nthe various 2D or 3D pairwise constraints. Our comparisons demonstrate that 3D\\nPS with RGB-D part detectors significantly improves the results in a visually\\nchallenging operating environment.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Topic models (e.g., pLSA, LDA, SLDA) have been widely used for segmenting\\nimagery. These models are confined to crisp segmentation. Yet, there are many\\nimages in which some regions cannot be assigned a crisp label (e.g., transition\\nregions between a foggy sky and the ground or between sand and water at a\\nbeach). In these cases, a visual word is best represented with partial\\nmemberships across multiple topics. To address this, we present a partial\\nmembership latent Dirichlet allocation (PM-LDA) model and associated parameter\\nestimation algorithms.

       "  'summary': u'  This paper addresses semantic image segmentation by incorporating rich\\ninformation into Markov Random Field (MRF), including high-order relations and\\nmixture of label contexts. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using\\niterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN), which enables deterministic\\nend-to-end computation in a single forward pass. Specifically, DPN extends a\\ncontemporary CNN architecture to model unary terms and additional layers are\\ncarefully devised to approximate the mean field algorithm (MF) for pairwise\\nterms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the recent\\nworks that combined CNN and MRF, where many iterations of MF were required for\\neach training image during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high\\nperformance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents\\nvarious types of pairwise terms, making many existing works as its special\\ncases. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up in\\nGraphical Processing Unit (GPU). DPN is thoroughly evaluated on the PASCAL VOC\\n2012 dataset, where a single DPN model yields a new state-of-the-art\\nsegmentation accuracy.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We present a deep layered architecture that generalizes convolutional neural\\nnetworks (ConvNets). The architecture, called SimNets, is driven by two\\noperators: (i) a similarity function that generalizes inner-product, and (ii) a\\nlog-mean-exp function called MEX that generalizes maximum and average. The two\\noperators applied in succession give rise to a standard neuron but in \"feature\\nspace\". The feature spaces realized by SimNets depend on the choice of the\\nsimilarity operator. The simplest setting, which corresponds to a convolution,\\nrealizes the feature space of the Exponential kernel, while other settings\\nrealize feature spaces of more powerful kernels (Generalized Gaussian, which\\nincludes as special cases RBF and Laplacian), or even dynamically learned\\nfeature spaces (Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning). As a result, the SimNet\\ncontains a higher abstraction level compared to a traditional ConvNet. We argue\\nthat enhanced expressiveness is important when the networks are small due to\\nrun-time constraints (such as those imposed by mobile applications). Empirical\\nevaluation validates the superior expressiveness of SimNets, showing a\\nsignificant gain in accuracy over ConvNets when computational resources at\\nrun-time are limited. We also show that in large-scale settings, where\\ncomputational complexity is less of a concern, the additional capacity of\\nSimNets can be controlled with proper regularization, yielding accuracies\\ncomparable to state of the art ConvNets.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Using phonological speech vocoding, we propose a platform for exploring\\nrelations between phonology and speech processing, and in broader terms, for\\nexploring relations between the abstract and physical structures of a speech\\nsignal. Our goal is to make a step towards bridging phonology and speech\\nprocessing and to contribute to the program of Laboratory Phonology. We show\\nthree application examples for laboratory phonology: compositional phonological\\nspeech modelling, a comparison of phonological systems and an experimental\\nphonological parametric text-to-speech (TTS) system. The featural\\nrepresentations of the following three phonological systems are considered in\\nthis work: (i) Government Phonology (GP), (ii) the Sound Pattern of English\\n(SPE), and (iii) the extended SPE (eSPE). Comparing GP- and eSPE-based vocoded\\nspeech, we conclude that the latter achieves slightly better results than the\\nformer. However, GP - the most compact phonological speech representation -\\nperforms comparably to the systems with a higher number of phonological\\nfeatures. The parametric TTS based on phonological speech representation, and\\ntrained from an unlabelled audiobook in an unsupervised manner, achieves\\nintelligibility of 85% of the state-of-the-art parametric speech synthesis. We\\nenvision that the presented approach paves the way for researchers in both\\nfields to form meaningful hypotheses that are explicitly testable using the\\nconcepts developed and exemplified in this paper. On the one hand, laboratory\\nphonologists might test the applied concepts of their theoretical models, and\\non the other hand, the speech processing community may utilize the concepts\\ndeveloped for the theoretical phonological models for improvements of the\\ncurrent state-of-the-art applications.\\n',\n",

Nevertheless, the majority of methods\\nfocus on analysing images captured in visible spectrum. In this manuscript we\\nelaborate on the problem of segmenting cross-country scenes captured in IR\\nspectrum. For this purpose we proposed employing salient features. Salient\\nfeatures are robust to variations in scale, brightness and view angle. We\\nsuggest the Speeded-Up Robust Features as a basis for our salient features for\\na number of reasons discussed in the paper. We also provide a comparison of two\\nSURF implementations. The SURF features are extracted from images of different\\nterrain types. For every feature we estimate a terrain class membership\\nfunction. The membership values are obtained by means of either the multi-layer\\nperceptron or nearest neighbours. The features' class membership values and\\ntheir spatial positions are then applied to estimate class membership values\\nfor all pixels in the image. To decrease the effect of segmentation blinking\\nthat is caused by rapid switching between different terrain types and to speed\\nup segmentation, we are tracking camera position and predict features'\\npositions. The comparison of the multi-layer perception and the nearest\\nneighbour classifiers is presented in the paper. The error rate of the terrain\\nsegmentation using the nearest neighbours obtained on the testing set is\\n16.6+-9.17%.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u'  High dimensional nonparametric regression is an inherently difficult problem\\nwith known lower bounds depending exponentially in dimension. A popular\\nstrategy to alleviate this curse of dimensionality has been to use additive\\nmodels of \\\\emph{first order}, which model the regression function as a sum of\\nindependent functions on each dimension. Though useful in controlling the\\nvariance of the estimate, such models are often too restrictive in practical\\nsettings. Between non-additive models which often have large variance and first\\norder additive models which have large bias, there has been little work to\\nexploit the trade-off in the middle via additive models of intermediate order.\\nIn this work, we propose SALSA, which bridges this gap by allowing interactions\\nbetween variables, but controls model capacity by limiting the order of\\ninteractions. SALSA minimises the residual sum of squares with squared RKHS\\nnorm penalties. Algorithmically, it can be viewed as Kernel Ridge Regression\\nwith an additive kernel. When the regression function is additive, the excess\\nrisk is only polynomial in dimension. Using the Girard-Newton formulae, we\\nefficiently sum over a combinatorial number of terms in the additive expansion.\\nVia a comparison on $15$ real datasets, we show that our method is competitive\\nagainst $21$ other alternatives.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  We consider the problem of learning preferences over trajectories for mobile\\nmanipulators such as personal robots and assembly line robots. The preferences\\nwe learn are more intricate than simple geometric constraints on trajectories;\\nthey are rather governed by the surrounding context of various objects and\\nhuman interactions in the environment. We propose a coactive online learning\\nframework for teaching preferences in contextually rich environments. The key\\nnovelty of our approach lies in the type of feedback expected from the user:\\nthe human user does not need to demonstrate optimal trajectories as training\\ndata, but merely needs to iteratively provide trajectories that slightly\\nimprove over the trajectory currently proposed by the system. We argue that\\nthis coactive preference feedback can be more easily elicited than\\ndemonstrations of optimal trajectories. Nevertheless, theoretical regret bounds\\nof our algorithm match the asymptotic rates of optimal trajectory algorithms.\\n  We implement our algorithm on two high degree-of-freedom robots, PR2 and\\nBaxter, and present three intuitive mechanisms for providing such incremental\\nfeedback.

       "  'summary': u'  Conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use either a linear or\\nnon-linear filter to extract features from an image patch (region) of spatial\\nsize $ H\\\\times W $ (Typically, $ H $ is small and is equal to $ W$, e.g., $ H $\\nis 5 or 7). Generally, the size of the filter is equal to the size $ H\\\\times W\\n$ of the input patch. We argue that the representation ability of equal-size\\nstrategy is not strong enough. To overcome the drawback, we propose to use\\nsubpatch filter whose spatial size $ h\\\\times w $ is smaller than $ H\\\\times W $.\\nThe proposed subpatch filter consists of two subsequent filters. The first one\\nis a linear filter of spatial size $ h\\\\times w $ and is aimed at extracting\\nfeatures from spatial domain. The second one is of spatial size $ 1\\\\times 1 $\\nand is used for strengthening the connection between different input feature\\nchannels and for reducing the number of parameters. The subpatch filter\\nconvolves with the input patch and the resulting network is called a subpatch\\nnetwork. Taking the output of one subpatch network as input, we further repeat\\nconstructing subpatch networks until the output contains only one neuron in\\nspatial domain. These subpatch networks form a new network called Cascaded\\nSubpatch Network (CSNet). The feature layer generated by CSNet is called csconv\\nlayer. For the whole input image, we construct a deep neural network by\\nstacking a sequence of csconv layers. Experimental results on four benchmark\\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and compactness of the proposed CSNet.\\nFor example, our CSNet reaches a test error of $ 5.68\\\\% $ on the CIFAR10\\ndataset without model averaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best\\nresult ever obtained on the CIFAR10 dataset.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  An important theoretical question in evolutionary computation is how good\\nsolutions evolutionary algorithms can produce. This paper aims to provide an\\nanalytic analysis of solution quality of evolutionary algorithms in terms of\\nthe performance rate, which is defined by the difference between 1 and the\\napproximation ratio of the best solution found in each generation. The\\nperformance rate can be represented by a function of time. With the help of\\nmatrix analysis, it is possible to obtain an exact expression of such a\\nfunction. For the first time, an analytic expression for calculating the\\nperformance rate is presented in this paper for a class of evolutionary\\nalgorithms, that is, (1+1) strictly elitist evolution algorithms. Furthermore,\\nanalytic expressions for calculate the fitness value and the average\\nconvergence rate in each generation are also derived for this class of\\nevolutionary algorithms. The approach is promising, and it can be extended to\\nnon-elitist or population-based algorithms too.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u\"  From a grammar point of view, the role of punctuation marks in a sentence is\\nformally defined and well understood. In semantic analysis punctuation plays\\nalso a crucial role as a method of avoiding ambiguity of the meaning. A\\ndifferent situation can be observed in the statistical analyses of language\\nsamples, where the decision on whether the punctuation marks should be\\nconsidered or should be neglected is seen rather as arbitrary and at present it\\nbelongs to a researcher's preference. An objective of this work is to shed some\\nlight onto this problem by providing us with an answer to the question whether\\nthe punctuation marks may be treated as ordinary words and whether they should\\nbe included in any analysis of the word co-occurences. We already know from our\\nprevious study \\\\cite{drozdz2016} that full stops that determine the length of\\nsentences are the main carrier of long-range correlations. Now we extend that\\nstudy and analyze statistical properties of the most common punctuation marks\\nin a few Indo-European languages, investigate their frequencies, and locate\\nthem accordingly in the Zipf rank-frequency plots as well as study their role\\nin the word-adjacency networks. We show that, from a statistical viewpoint, the\\npunctuation marks reveal properties that are qualitatively similar to the\\nproperties of the most frequent words like articles, conjunctions, pronouns,\\nand prepositions. This refers to both the Zipfian analysis and the network\\nanalysis. Our results can be exploited in the computer-based analyses of large\\ntext corpora and be incorporated in the related automated systems. As a side\\nresult, we propose an efficient method of sampling the language corpora for a\\nword-adjacency network analysis.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Existing fine-grained visual categorization methods often suffer from three\\nchallenges: lack of training data, large number of fine-grained categories, and\\nhigh intraclass vs. low inter-class variance. In this work we propose a generic\\niterative framework for fine-grained categorization and dataset bootstrapping\\nthat handles these three challenges. Using deep metric learning with humans in\\nthe loop, we learn a low dimensional feature embedding with anchor points on\\nmanifolds for each category. These anchor points capture intra-class variances\\nand remain discriminative between classes. In each round, images with high\\nconfidence scores from our model are sent to humans for labeling. By comparing\\nwith exemplar images, labelers mark each candidate image as either a \"true\\npositive\" or a \"false positive\". True positives are added into our current\\ndataset and false positives are regarded as \"hard negatives\" for our metric\\nlearning model. Then the model is retrained with an expanded dataset and hard\\nnegatives for the next round. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\\nframework, we bootstrap a fine-grained flower dataset with 620 categories from\\nInstagram images. The proposed deep metric learning scheme is evaluated on both\\nour dataset and the CUB-200-2001 Birds dataset. Experimental evaluations show\\nsignificant performance gain using dataset bootstrapping and demonstrate\\nstate-of-the-art results achieved by the proposed deep metric learning methods.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Real time application of deep learning algorithms is often hindered by high\\ncomputational complexity and frequent memory accesses. Network pruning is a\\npromising technique to solve this problem. However, pruning usually results in\\nirregular network connections that not only demand extra representation efforts\\nbut also do not fit well on parallel computation. We introduce structured\\nsparsity at various scales for convolutional neural networks, which are channel\\nwise, kernel wise and intra kernel strided sparsity. This structured sparsity\\nis very advantageous for direct computational resource savings on embedded\\ncomputers, parallel computing environments and hardware based systems. To\\ndecide the importance of network connections and paths, the proposed method\\nuses a particle filtering approach. The importance weight of each particle is\\nassigned by computing the misclassification rate with corresponding\\nconnectivity pattern. The pruned network is re-trained to compensate for the\\nlosses due to pruning. While implementing convolutions as matrix products, we\\nparticularly show that intra kernel strided sparsity with a simple constraint\\ncan significantly reduce the size of kernel and feature map matrices.

In this paper, we propose a novel kernel-based model for the\\nNMF that does not suffer from the pre-image problem, by investigating the\\nestimation of the factorization matrices directly in the input space. For\\ndifferent kernel functions, we describe two schemes for iterative algorithms:\\nan additive update rule based on a gradient descent scheme and a multiplicative\\nupdate rule in the same spirit as in the Lee and Seung algorithm.

In this paper, a hybrid hand pose estimation method is proposed by\\napplying the kinematic hierarchy strategy to the input space (as well as the\\noutput space) of the discriminative method by a spatial attention mechanism and\\nto the optimization of the generative method by hierarchical Particle Swarm\\nOptimization (PSO). The spatial attention mechanism integrates cascaded and\\nhierarchical regression into a CNN framework by transforming both the input(and\\nfeature space) and the output space, which greatly reduces the viewpoint and\\narticulation variations. Between the levels in the hierarchy, the hierarchical\\nPSO forces the kinematic constraints to the results of the CNNs. The\\nexperimental results show that our method significantly outperforms four\\nstate-of-the-art methods and three baselines on three public benchmarks.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  The success of automatic classification of variable stars strongly depends on\\nthe lightcurve representation. Usually, lightcurves are represented as a vector\\nof many statistical descriptors designed by astronomers called features. These\\ndescriptors commonly demand significant computational power to calculate,\\nrequire substantial research effort to develop and do not guarantee good\\nperformance on the final classification task. Today, lightcurve representation\\nis not entirely automatic; algorithms that extract lightcurve features are\\ndesigned by humans and must be manually tuned up for every survey. The vast\\namounts of data that will be generated in future surveys like LSST mean\\nastronomers must develop analysis pipelines that are both scalable and\\nautomated. Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the machine learning\\ncommunity to develop methods that prescind from expert-designed and manually\\ntuned features for features that are automatically learned from data. In this\\nwork we present what is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised feature\\nlearning algorithm designed for variable stars. Our method first extracts a\\nlarge number of lightcurve subsequences from a given set of photometric data,\\nwhich are then clustered to find common local patterns in the time series.\\nRepresentatives of these patterns, called exemplars, are then used to transform\\nlightcurves of a labeled set into a new representation that can then be used to\\ntrain an automatic classifier. The proposed algorithm learns the features from\\nboth labeled and unlabeled lightcurves, overcoming the bias generated when the\\nlearning process is done only with labeled data. We test our method on MACHO\\nand OGLE datasets; the results show that the classification performance we\\nachieve is as good and in some cases better than the performance achieved using\\ntraditional features, while the computational cost is significantly lower.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Facial expressions are widely used in the behavioral interpretation of\\nemotions, cognitive science, and social interactions. In this paper, we present\\na novel method for fully automatic facial expression recognition in facial\\nimage sequences. As the facial expression evolves over time facial landmarks\\nare automatically tracked in consecutive video frames, using displacements\\nbased on elastic bunch graph matching displacement estimation. Feature vectors\\nfrom individual landmarks, as well as pairs of landmarks tracking results are\\nextracted, and normalized, with respect to the first frame in the sequence. The\\nprototypical expression sequence for each class of facial expression is formed,\\nby taking the median of the landmark tracking results from the training facial\\nexpression sequences. Multi-class AdaBoost with dynamic time warping similarity\\ndistance between the feature vector of input facial expression and prototypical\\nfacial expression, is used as a weak classifier to select the subset of\\ndiscriminative feature vectors. Finally, two methods for facial expression\\nrecognition are presented, either by using multi-class AdaBoost with dynamic\\ntime warping, or by using support vector machine on the boosted feature\\nvectors. The results on the Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial expression database show a\\nrecognition accuracy of 95.17% and 97.35% using multi-class AdaBoost and\\nsupport vector machines, respectively.\\n',\n",

In these problems, the objective is the sum of two closed,\\nproper, and convex functions where one is smooth and the other admits a\\ncomputationally inexpensive proximal operator. We analyze a general family of\\ninertial proximal splitting algorithms (GIPSA) for solving such problems. We\\nestablish finiteness of the sum of squared increments of the iterates and\\noptimality of the accumulation points. Weak convergence of the entire sequence\\nthen follows if the minimum is attained.

For certain\\nparameter choices, GIPSA is amenable to a local analysis for this problem. For\\nthese choices we show that GIPSA achieves finite \"active manifold\\nidentification\", i.e. convergence in a finite number of iterations to the\\noptimal support and sign, after which GIPSA reduces to minimizing a local\\nsmooth function. Local linear convergence then holds under certain conditions.\\nWe determine the rate in terms of the inertia, stepsize, and local curvature.\\nOur local analysis is applicable to certain recent variants of the Fast\\nIterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), for which we establish\\nactive manifold identification and local linear convergence.

These approaches are\\nfar from ideal in highly dynamic recommendation domains such as news\\nrecommendation and computational advertisement, where the set of items and\\nusers is very fluid. In this work, we investigate an adaptive clustering\\ntechnique for content recommendation based on exploration-exploitation\\nstrategies in contextual multi-armed bandit settings.

The resulting algorithm thus takes\\nadvantage of preference patterns in the data in a way akin to collaborative\\nfiltering methods. We provide an empirical analysis on medium-size real-world\\ndatasets, showing scalability and increased prediction performance (as measured\\nby click-through rate) over state-of-the-art methods for clustering bandits.

Existing methods rely on per-pixel based multi-scale\\nfeature computation, which results in difficult modeling and high time\\nconsumption. In this paper, we present a fully convolutional network with\\nmultiple scale-associated side outputs to address this problem. By observing\\nthe relationship between the receptive field sizes of the sequential stages in\\nthe network and the skeleton scales they can capture, we introduce a\\nscale-associated side output to each stage. We impose supervision to different\\nstages by guiding the scale-associated side outputs toward groundtruth\\nskeletons of different scales. The responses of the multiple scale-associated\\nside outputs are then fused in a scale-specific way to localize skeleton pixels\\nwith multiple scales effectively.

       "  'summary': u\"  Discrete return (DR) Laser Detection and Ranging (Ladar) systems provide a\\nseries of echoes that reflect from objects in a scene. These can be first, last\\nor multi-echo returns. In contrast, Full-Waveform (FW)-Ladar systems measure\\nthe intensity of light reflected from objects continuously over a period of\\ntime. In a camouflaged scenario, e.g., objects hidden behind dense foliage, a\\nFW-Ladar penetrates such foliage and returns a sequence of echoes including\\nburied faint echoes. The aim of this paper is to learn local-patterns of\\nco-occurring echoes characterised by their measured spectra. A deviation from\\nsuch patterns defines an abnormal event in a forest/tree depth profile. As far\\nas the authors know, neither DR or FW-Ladar, along with several spectral\\nmeasurements, has not been applied to anomaly detection. This work presents an\\nalgorithm that allows detection of spectral and temporal anomalies in FW-Multi\\nSpectral Ladar (FW-MSL) data samples. An anomaly is defined as a full waveform\\ntemporal and spectral signature that does not conform to a prior expectation,\\nrepresented using a learnt subspace (dictionary) and set of coefficients that\\ncapture co-occurring local-patterns using an overlapping temporal window. A\\nmodified optimization scheme is proposed for subspace learning based on\\nstochastic approximations. The objective function is augmented with a\\ndiscriminative term that represents the subspace's separability properties and\\nsupports anomaly characterisation. The algorithm detects several man-made\\nobjects and anomalous spectra hidden in a dense clutter of vegetation and also\\nallows tree species classification.\\n\",\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Deep networks have recently enjoyed enormous success when applied to\\nrecognition and classification problems in computer vision, but their use in\\ngraphics problems has been limited. In this work, we present a novel deep\\narchitecture that performs new view synthesis directly from pixels, trained\\nfrom a large number of posed image sets. In contrast to traditional approaches\\nwhich consist of multiple complex stages of processing, each of which require\\ncareful tuning and can fail in unexpected ways, our system is trained\\nend-to-end. The pixels from neighboring views of a scene are presented to the\\nnetwork which then directly produces the pixels of the unseen view. The\\nbenefits of our approach include generality (we only require posed image sets\\nand can easily apply our method to different domains), and high quality results\\non traditionally difficult scenes. We believe this is due to the end-to-end\\nnature of our system which is able to plausibly generate pixels according to\\ncolor, depth, and texture priors learnt automatically from the training data.\\nTo verify our method we show that it can convincingly reproduce known test\\nviews from nearby imagery. Additionally we show images rendered from novel\\nviewpoints.

       "  'summary': u'  Obtaining semantic labels on a large scale radiology image database (215,786\\nkey images from 61,845 unique patients) is a prerequisite yet bottleneck to\\ntrain highly effective deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for image\\nrecognition. Nevertheless, conventional methods for collecting image labels\\n(e.g., Google search followed by crowd-sourcing) are not applicable due to the\\nformidable difficulties of medical annotation tasks for those who are not\\nclinically trained. This type of image labeling task remains non-trivial even\\nfor radiologists due to uncertainty and possible drastic inter-observer\\nvariation or inconsistency.\\n  In this paper, we present a looped deep pseudo-task optimization procedure\\nfor automatic category discovery of visually coherent and clinically semantic\\n(concept) clusters. Our system can be initialized by domain-specific (CNN\\ntrained on radiology images and text report derived labels) or generic\\n(ImageNet based) CNN models. Afterwards, a sequence of pseudo-tasks are\\nexploited by the looped deep image feature clustering (to refine image labels)\\nand deep CNN training/classification using new labels (to obtain more task\\nrepresentative deep features). Our method is conceptually simple and based on\\nthe hypothesized \"convergence\" of better labels leading to better trained CNN\\nmodels which in turn feed more effective deep image features to facilitate more\\nmeaningful clustering/labels. We have empirically validated the convergence and\\ndemonstrated promising quantitative and qualitative results. Category labels of\\nsignificantly higher quality than those in previous work are discovered. This\\nallows for further investigation of the hierarchical semantic nature of the\\ngiven large-scale radiology image database.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Spontaneous subtle emotions are expressed through micro-expressions, which\\nare tiny, sudden and short-lived dynamics of facial muscles; thus poses a great\\nchallenge for visual recognition. The abrupt but significant dynamics for the\\nrecognition task are temporally sparse while the rest, irrelevant dynamics, are\\ntemporally redundant. In this work, we analyze and enforce sparsity constrains\\nto learn significant temporal and spectral structures while eliminate\\nirrelevant facial dynamics of micro-expressions, which would ease the challenge\\nin the visual recognition of spontaneous subtle emotions. The hypothesis is\\nconfirmed through experimental results of automatic spontaneous subtle emotion\\nrecognition with several sparsity levels on CASME II and SMIC, the only two\\npublicly available spontaneous subtle emotion databases. The overall\\nperformances of the automatic subtle emotion recognition are boosted when only\\nsignificant dynamics are preserved from the original sequences.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Traditional methods for motion estimation estimate the motion field F between\\na pair of images as the one that minimizes a predesigned cost function. In this\\npaper, we propose a direct method and train a Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN) that when, at test time, is given a pair of images as input it produces a\\ndense motion field F at its output layer. In the absence of large datasets with\\nground truth motion that would allow classical supervised training, we propose\\nto train the network in an unsupervised manner. The proposed cost function that\\nis optimized during training, is based on the classical optical flow\\nconstraint.

       "  'summary': u'  Most image instance retrieval pipelines are based on comparison of vectors\\nknown as global image descriptors between a query image and the database\\nimages. Due to their success in large scale image classification,\\nrepresentations extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are quickly\\ngaining ground on Fisher Vectors (FVs) as state-of-the-art global descriptors\\nfor image instance retrieval. While CNN-based descriptors are generally\\nremarked for good retrieval performance at lower bitrates, they nevertheless\\npresent a number of drawbacks including the lack of robustness to common object\\ntransformations such as rotations compared with their interest point based FV\\ncounterparts.\\n  In this paper, we propose a method for computing invariant global descriptors\\nfrom CNNs.

The\\nresulting global descriptors can be made invariant to multiple arbitrary\\ntransformation groups while retaining good discriminativeness.\\n  Based on a thorough empirical evaluation using several publicly available\\ndatasets, we show that our method is able to significantly and consistently\\nimprove retrieval results every time a new type of invariance is incorporated.\\nWe also show that our method which has few parameters is not prone to\\noverfitting: improvements generalize well across datasets with different\\nproperties with regard to invariances. Finally, we show that our descriptors\\nare able to compare favourably to other state-of-the-art compact descriptors in\\nsimilar bitranges, exceeding the highest retrieval results reported in the\\nliterature on some datasets. A dedicated dimensionality reduction step\\n--quantization or hashing-- may be able to further improve the competitiveness\\nof the descriptors.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently achieved remarkable\\nsuccesses in various image classification and understanding tasks. The deep\\nfeatures obtained at the top fully-connected layer of the CNN (FC-features)\\nexhibit rich global semantic information and are extremely effective in image\\nclassification. On the other hand, the convolutional features in the middle\\nlayers of the CNN also contain meaningful local information, but are not fully\\nexplored for image representation. In this paper, we propose a novel\\nLocally-Supervised Deep Hybrid Model (LS-DHM) that effectively enhances and\\nexplores the convolutional features for scene recognition. Firstly, we notice\\nthat the convolutional features capture local objects and fine structures of\\nscene images, which yield important cues for discriminating ambiguous scenes,\\nwhereas these features are significantly eliminated in the highly-compressed FC\\nrepresentation. Secondly, we propose a new Local Convolutional Supervision\\n(LCS) layer to enhance the local structure of the image by directly propagating\\nthe label information to the convolutional layers. Thirdly, we propose an\\nefficient Fisher Convolutional Vector (FCV) that successfully rescues the\\norderless mid-level semantic information (e.g. objects and textures) of scene\\nimage. The FCV encodes the large-sized convolutional maps into a fixed-length\\nmid-level representation, and is demonstrated to be strongly complementary to\\nthe high-level FC-features. Finally, both the FCV and FC-features are\\ncollaboratively employed in the LSDHM representation, which achieves\\noutstanding performance in our experiments. It obtains 83.75% and 67.56%\\naccuracies respectively on the heavily benchmarked MIT Indoor67 and SUN397\\ndatasets, advancing the stat-of-the-art substantially.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  A wide range of resource allocation and platform operation settings exhibit\\nthe following two simultaneous challenges: (1) service resources are capacity\\nconstrained; and (2) clients\\' preferences are not perfectly known. To study\\nthis pair of challenges, we consider a service system with heterogeneous\\nservers and clients. Server types are known and there is fixed capacity of\\nservers of each type. Clients arrive over time, with types initially unknown\\nand drawn from some distribution. Each client sequentially brings $N$ jobs\\nbefore leaving.

We construct a policy that has provably optimal regret (to leading\\norder as $N$ grows large). Our policy has an appealingly simple three-phase\\nstructure: a short type-\"guessing\" phase, a type-\"confirmation\" phase that\\nbalances payoffs with learning, and finally an \"exploitation\" phase that\\nfocuses on payoffs.

       "  'summary': u'  Features based on sparse representation, especially using the synthesis\\ndictionary model, have been heavily exploited in signal processing and computer\\nvision. However, synthesis dictionary learning typically involves NP-hard\\nsparse coding and expensive learning steps. Recently, sparsifying transform\\nlearning received interest for its cheap computation and its optimal updates in\\nthe alternating algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for learning\\nof Flipping and Rotation Invariant Sparsifying Transforms, dubbed FRIST, to\\nbetter represent natural images that contain textures with various geometrical\\ndirections. The proposed alternating learning algorithm involves efficient\\noptimal updates.

We then discuss Shafer belief functions, a\\ngeneralization of probability distributions, which can deal with both these\\nobjections. We use a calculus of belief functions which does not use the much\\ncriticized Dempster rule of combination, but only the very natural\\nDempster-Shafer conditioning. We then apply this calculus to some classical\\nforensic problems like the various island problems and the problem of parental\\nidentification. If we impose no prior knowledge apart from assuming that the\\nculprit or parent belongs to a given population (something which is possible in\\nour setting), then our answers differ from the classical ones when uniform or\\nother priors are imposed. We can actually retrieve the classical answers by\\nimposing the relevant priors, so our setup can and should be interpreted as a\\ngeneralization of the classical methodology, allowing more flexibility.

       "  'summary': u'  In this paper, we propose a new deep learning approach, called neural\\nassociation model (NAM), for probabilistic reasoning in artificial\\nintelligence. We propose to use neural networks to model association between\\nany two events in a domain. Neural networks take one event as input and compute\\na conditional probability of the other event to model how likely these two\\nevents are associated. The actual meaning of the conditional probabilities\\nvaries between applications and depends on how the models are trained.

       "  'summary': u'  Extractive summarization aims at selecting a set of indicative sentences from\\na source document as a summary that can express the major theme of the\\ndocument. A general consensus on extractive summarization is that both\\nrelevance and coverage are critical issues to address. The existing methods\\ndesigned to model coverage can be characterized by either reducing redundancy\\nor increasing diversity in the summary. Maximal margin relevance (MMR) is a\\nwidely-cited method since it takes both relevance and redundancy into account\\nwhen generating a summary for a given document. In addition to MMR, there is\\nonly a dearth of research concentrating on reducing redundancy or increasing\\ndiversity for the spoken document summarization task, as far as we are aware.\\nMotivated by these observations, two major contributions are presented in this\\npaper. First, in contrast to MMR, which considers coverage by reducing\\nredundancy, we propose two novel coverage-based methods, which directly\\nincrease diversity. With the proposed methods, a set of representative\\nsentences, which not only are relevant to the given document but also cover\\nmost of the important sub-themes of the document, can be selected\\nautomatically. Second, we make a step forward to plug in several\\ndocument/sentence representation methods into the proposed framework to further\\nenhance the summarization performance. A series of empirical evaluations\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Recent leading approaches to semantic segmentation rely on deep convolutional\\nnetworks trained with human-annotated, pixel-level segmentation masks.

In\\nthis paper, we propose a method that achieves competitive accuracy but only\\nrequires easily obtained bounding box annotations. The basic idea is to iterate\\nbetween automatically generating region proposals and training convolutional\\nnetworks.

       "  'summary': u'  We derive a synaptic weight update rule for learning temporally precise spike\\ntrain to spike train transformations in multilayer feedforward networks of\\nspiking neurons. The framework, aimed at seamlessly generalizing error\\nbackpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron setting, is based strictly\\non spike timing and avoids invoking concepts pertaining to spike rates or\\nprobabilistic models of spiking. The derivation is founded on two innovations.\\nFirst, an error functional is proposed that compares the spike train emitted by\\nthe output neuron of the network to the desired spike train by way of their\\nputative impact on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps\\nthe need for spike alignment and leads to closed form solutions for all\\nquantities of interest. Second, virtual assignment of weights to spikes rather\\nthan synapses enables a perturbation analysis of individual spike times and\\nsynaptic weights of the output as well as all intermediate neurons in the\\nnetwork, which yields the gradients of the error functional with respect to the\\nsaid entities. Learning proceeds via a gradient descent mechanism that\\nleverages these quantities. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of\\nthe proposed learning framework.

Rapid progress has been\\nmade in terms of both developing novel algorithms and releasing new datasets.\\nIndeed, the state-of-the-art results on some of the standard datasets have been\\npushed into the regime where it has become more and more difficult to make\\nsignificant improvements. Instead of proposing new models, this work\\ninvestigates the possibility of empirically establishing performance upper\\nbounds on various visual captioning datasets without extra data labelling\\neffort or human evaluation. In particular, it is assumed that visual captioning\\nis decomposed into two steps: from visual inputs to visual concepts, and from\\nvisual concepts to natural language descriptions. One would be able to obtain\\nan upper bound when assuming the first step is perfect and only requiring\\ntraining a conditional language model for the second step. We demonstrate the\\nconstruction of such bounds on MS-COCO, YouTube2Text and LSMDC (a combination\\nof M-VAD and MPII-MD). Surprisingly, despite of the imperfect process we used\\nfor visual concept extraction in the first step and the simplicity of the\\nlanguage model for the second step, we show that current state-of-the-art\\nmodels fall short when being compared with the learned upper bounds.\\nFurthermore, with such a bound, we quantify several important factors\\nconcerning image and video captioning: the number of visual concepts captured\\nby different models, the trade-off between the amount of visual elements\\ncaptured and their accuracy, and the intrinsic difficulty and blessing of\\ndifferent datasets.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Automatically describing video content with natural language is a fundamental\\nchallenge of multimedia. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which models sequence\\ndynamics, has attracted increasing attention on visual interpretation. However,\\nmost existing approaches generate a word locally with given previous words and\\nthe visual content, while the relationship between sentence semantics and\\nvisual content is not holistically exploited. As a result, the generated\\nsentences may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs\\nor objects) are not true.\\n  This paper presents a novel unified framework, named Long Short-Term Memory\\nwith visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E), which can simultaneously explore the\\nlearning of LSTM and visual-semantic embedding. The former aims to locally\\nmaximize the probability of generating the next word given previous words and\\nvisual content, while the latter is to create a visual-semantic embedding space\\nfor enforcing the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and\\nvisual content. Our proposed LSTM-E consists of three components: a 2-D and/or\\n3-D deep convolutional neural networks for learning powerful video\\nrepresentation, a deep RNN for generating sentences, and a joint embedding\\nmodel for exploring the relationships between visual content and sentence\\nsemantics. The experiments on YouTube2Text dataset show that our proposed\\nLSTM-E achieves to-date the best reported performance in generating natural\\nsentences: 45.3% and 31.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and METEOR, respectively. We also\\ndemonstrate that LSTM-E is superior in predicting Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)\\ntriplets to several state-of-the-art techniques.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Modern deep neural network based object detection methods typically classify\\ncandidate proposals using their interior features. However, global and local\\nsurrounding contexts that are believed to be valuable for object detection are\\nnot fully exploited by existing methods yet. In this work, we take a step\\ntowards understanding what is a robust practice to extract and utilize\\ncontextual information to facilitate object detection in practice.\\nSpecifically, we consider the following two questions: \"how to identify useful\\nglobal contextual information for detecting a certain object?\" and \"how to\\nexploit local context surrounding a proposal for better inferring its\\ncontents?\". We provide preliminary answers to these questions through\\ndeveloping a novel Attention to Context Convolution Neural Network (AC-CNN)\\nbased object detection model. AC-CNN effectively incorporates global and local\\ncontextual information into the region-based CNN (e.g. Fast RCNN) detection\\nmodel and provides better object detection performance. It consists of one\\nattention-based global contextualized (AGC) sub-network and one multi-scale\\nlocal contextualized (MLC) sub-network. To capture global context, the AGC\\nsub-network recurrently generates an attention map for an input image to\\nhighlight useful global contextual locations, through multiple stacked Long\\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. For capturing surrounding local context, the\\nMLC sub-network exploits both the inside and outside contextual information of\\neach specific proposal at multiple scales. The global and local context are\\nthen fused together for making the final decision for detection. Extensive\\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 well demonstrate the superiority of\\nthe proposed AC-CNN over well-established baselines. In particular, AC-CNN\\noutperforms the popular Fast-RCNN by 2.0% and 2.2% on VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 in\\nterms of mAP, respectively.\\n',\n",

Most of these learning methods, though, rely on large training\\nsets of images associated with human annotations that specifically describe the\\nvisual content. In this paper we propose to go a step further and explore the\\nmore complex cases where textual descriptions are loosely related to the\\nimages. We focus on the particular domain of News articles in which the textual\\ncontent often expresses connotative and ambiguous relations that are only\\nsuggested but not directly inferred from images. We introduce new deep learning\\nmethods that address source detection, popularity prediction, article\\nillustration and geolocation of articles. An adaptive CNN architecture is\\nproposed, that shares most of the structure for all the tasks, and is suitable\\nfor multitask and transfer learning. Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis is\\ndeployed for article illustration, and a new loss function based on Great\\nCircle Distance is proposed for geolocation. Furthermore, we present\\nBreakingNews, a novel dataset with approximately 100K news articles including\\nimages, text and captions, and enriched with heterogeneous meta-data (such as\\nGPS coordinates and popularity metrics). We show this dataset to be appropriate\\nto explore all aforementioned problems, for which we provide a baseline\\nperformance using various Deep Learning architectures, and different\\nrepresentations of the textual and visual features. We report very promising\\nresults and bring to light several limitations of current state-of-the-art in\\nthis kind of domain, which we hope will help spur progress in the field.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) can be used to\\nreconstruct fiber tracts, for example, in muscle and white matter. Estimation\\nof fiber orientations (FOs) is a crucial step in the reconstruction process and\\nthese estimates can be corrupted by noise. In this paper, a new method called\\nFiber Orientation Reconstruction using Neighborhood Information (FORNI) is\\ndescribed and shown to reduce the effects of noise and improve FO estimation\\nperformance by incorporating spatial consistency. FORNI uses a fixed tensor\\nbasis to model the diffusion weighted signals, which has the advantage of\\nproviding an explicit relationship between the basis vectors and the FOs. FO\\nspatial coherence is encouraged using weighted l1-norm regularization terms,\\nwhich contain the interaction of directional information between neighbor\\nvoxels. Data fidelity is encouraged using a squared error between the observed\\nand reconstructed diffusion weighted signals. After appropriate weighting of\\nthese competing objectives, the resulting objective function is minimized using\\na block coordinate descent algorithm, and a straightforward parallelization\\nstrategy is used to speed up processing. Experiments were performed on a\\ndigital crossing phantom, ex vivo tongue dMRI data, and in vivo brain dMRI data\\nfor both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The results demonstrate that\\nFORNI improves the quality of FO estimation over other state of the art\\nalgorithms.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  Understanding language goes hand in hand with the ability to integrate\\ncomplex contextual information obtained via perception. In this work, we\\npresent a novel task for grounded language understanding: disambiguating a\\nsentence given a visual scene which depicts one of the possible interpretations\\nof that sentence. To this end, we introduce a new multimodal corpus containing\\nambiguous sentences, representing a wide range of syntactic, semantic and\\ndiscourse ambiguities, coupled with videos that visualize the different\\ninterpretations for each sentence. We address this task by extending a vision\\nmodel which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video. We demonstrate how\\nsuch a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpretations of the same\\nunderlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a unified fashion\\nacross the different ambiguity types.\\n',\n",

The traditional methods\\nto solve this problem usually learns one single predictor for all the data\\npoints, and ignores the variety of the different data points.

       "  'summary': u'  Image representations, from SIFT and bag of visual words to Convolutional\\nNeural Networks (CNNs) are a crucial component of almost all computer vision\\nsystems. However, our understanding of them remains limited. In this paper we\\nstudy several landmark representations, both shallow and deep, by a number of\\ncomplementary visualization techniques. These visualizations are based on the\\nconcept of \"natural pre-image\", namely a natural-looking image whose\\nrepresentation has some notable property. We study in particular three such\\nvisualizations: inversion, in which the aim is to reconstruct an image from its\\nrepresentation, activation maximization, in which we search for patterns that\\nmaximally stimulate a representation component, and caricaturization, in which\\nthe visual patterns that a representation detects in an image are exaggerated.\\nWe pose these as a regularized energy-minimization framework and demonstrate\\nits generality and effectiveness. In particular, we show that this method can\\ninvert representations such as HOG more accurately than recent alternatives\\nwhile being applicable to CNNs too. Among our findings, we show that several\\nlayers in CNNs retain photographically accurate information about the image,\\nwith different degrees of geometric and photometric invariance.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  This paper investigates the problem of image classification with limited or\\nno annotations, but abundant unlabeled data. The setting exists in many tasks\\nsuch as semi-supervised image classification, image clustering, and image\\nretrieval. Unlike previous methods, which develop or learn sophisticated\\nregularizers for classifiers, our method learns a new image representation by\\nexploiting the distribution patterns of all available data for the task at\\nhand. Particularly, a rich set of visual prototypes are sampled from all\\navailable data, and are taken as surrogate classes to train discriminative\\nclassifiers; images are projected via the classifiers; the projected values,\\nsimilarities to the prototypes, are stacked to build the new feature vector.\\nThe training set is noisy. Hence, in the spirit of ensemble learning we create\\na set of such training sets which are all diverse, leading to diverse\\nclassifiers. The method is dubbed Ensemble Projection (EP). EP captures not\\nonly the characteristics of individual images, but also the relationships among\\nimages. It is conceptually simple and computationally efficient, yet effective\\nand flexible. Experiments on eight standard datasets show that: (1) EP\\noutperforms previous methods for semi-supervised image classification; (2) EP\\nproduces promising results for self-taught image classification, where\\nunlabeled samples are a random collection of images rather than being from the\\nsame distribution as the labeled ones; and (3) EP improves over the original\\nfeatures for image clustering. The code of the method is available on the\\nproject page.\\n',\n",

       "  'summary': u'  The constant growth in the present day real-world databases pose\\ncomputational challenges for a single computer. Cloud-based platforms, on the\\nother hand, are capable of handling large volumes of information manipulation\\ntasks, thereby necessitating their use for large real-world data set\\ncomputations. This work focuses on creating a novel Generalized Flow within the\\ncloud-based computing platform: Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (MAMLS)\\nthat accepts multi-class and binary classification data sets alike and\\nprocesses them to maximize the overall classification accuracy. First, each\\ndata set is split into training and testing data sets, respectively. Then,\\nlinear and nonlinear classification model parameters are estimated using the\\ntraining data set. Data dimensionality reduction is then performed to maximize\\nclassification accuracy. For multi-class data sets, data centric information is\\nused to further improve overall classification accuracy by reducing the\\nmulti-class classification to a series of hierarchical binary classification\\ntasks. Finally, the performance of optimized classification model thus achieved\\nis evaluated and scored on the testing data set. The classification\\ncharacteristics of the proposed flow are comparatively evaluated on 3 public\\ndata sets and a local data set with respect to existing state-of-the-art\\nmethods. On the 3 public data sets, the proposed flow achieves 78-97.5%\\nclassification accuracy. Also, the local data set, created using the\\ninformation regarding presence of Diabetic Retinopathy lesions in fundus\\nimages, results in 85.3-95.7% average classification accuracy, which is higher\\nthan the existing methods. Thus, the proposed generalized flow can be useful\\nfor a wide range of application-oriented \"big data sets\".\\n',\n",

However, curating such large-scale\\nvideo datasets requires immense human labor, and training CNNs on millions of\\nvideos demands huge computational resources. In contrast, collecting action\\nimages from the Web is much easier and training on images requires much less\\ncomputation. In addition, labeled web images tend to contain discriminative\\naction poses, which highlight discriminative portions of a video's temporal\\nprogression.

The physics parameters represent\\na smoothly varying learning task, and the resulting parameterized classifier\\ncan smoothly interpolate between them and replace sets of classifiers trained\\nat individual values. This simplifies the training process and gives improved\\nperformance at intermediate values, even for complex problems requiring deep\\nlearning. Applications include tools parameterized in terms of theoretical\\nmodel parameters, such as the mass of a particle, which allow for a single\\nnetwork to provide improved discrimination across a range of masses.

       "  'summary': u'  The present study introduces a method for improving the classification\\nperformance of imbalanced multiclass data streams from wireless body worn\\nsensors. Data imbalance is an inherent problem in activity recognition caused\\nby the irregular time distribution of activities, which are sequential and\\ndependent on previous movements. We use conditional random fields (CRF), a\\ngraphical model for structured classification, to take advantage of\\ndependencies between activities in a sequence. However, CRFs do not consider\\nthe negative effects of class imbalance during training. We propose a\\nclass-wise dynamically weighted CRF (dWCRF) where weights are automatically\\ndetermined during training by maximizing the expected overall F-score. Our\\nresults based on three case studies from a healthcare application using a\\nbatteryless body worn sensor, demonstrate that our method, in general, improves\\noverall and minority class F-score when compared to other CRF based classifiers\\nand achieves similar or better overall and class-wise performance when compared\\nto SVM based classifiers under conditions of limited training data. We also\\nconfirm the performance of our approach using an additional battery powered\\nbody worn sensor dataset, achieving similar results in cases of high class\\nimbalance.\\n',\n",

Our goal is to accurately predict the\\nprogress of the disease in individual patients. As very few measurements are\\navailable for each patient, it is difficult to produce good predictors for\\nindividuals. A recently proposed clustering-based method enhances the power of\\nprediction using patient data with similar spatiotemporal patterns. Each\\npatient is categorized into a cluster of patients, and a predictive model is\\nconstructed using all of the data in the class. Predictions are highly\\ndependent on the quality of clustering, but it is difficult to identify the\\nbest clustering method. Thus, we propose a method for aggregating cluster-based\\npredictors to obtain better prediction accuracy than from a single\\ncluster-based prediction. Further, the method shows very high performances by\\nhierarchically aggregating experts generated from several cluster-based\\nmethods. We use real datasets to demonstrate that our method performs\\nsignificantly better than conventional clustering-based and patient-wise\\nregression methods, because the hierarchical aggregating strategy has a\\nmechanism whereby good predictors in a small community can thrive.\\n',\n",
